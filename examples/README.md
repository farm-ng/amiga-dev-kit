# Amiga SDK Examples


## Cansniffer

Our most basic example covers a simple tool for listening to all CAN Id's streaming on the bus
and measuring simple statistics about the streamed messages.
The example is inspired by the
[cansniffer command line tool from can-utils](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/can-utils/cansniffer.1.en.html).

Topics:

- Serial port 101
- CAN introduction


## Hello World Auto-mode

This is example covers simple introduction to interacting with the amiga and
using auto-control mode to drive your Amiga from a computer
using the [farm-ng microcontroller Kit](https://farm-ng.com/products/microcontroller-kit).

Topics:

- Serial port interaction
- Auto-mode control


## FPV

This example shows how to connect off the shelf FPV equipment to your Amiga to enable realtime video streaming and teleoperation through remote control.  This makes the Amiga remotely operable from the comfort of your office (or cab of your truck) and we're pretty psyched by how low cost and practical FPV control of the Amiga is.

Topics:

- Hardware integration
- Auto-mode control
