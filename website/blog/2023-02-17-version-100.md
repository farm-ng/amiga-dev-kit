At farm-ng we love making tools for engineers, hackers, building
communities, and inspiring people to make their own. For this
reason, we are excited to announce the release of the
**AmigaOS Artichoke 1.0**, the operating system and software
development kit for the Farm-ng Amiga platform.

The release goes aligned with the starting of the
[Farm Robotics Challenge 2023](https://farmbot.ai/) to help the
student to bootstrap their ideas.

## The Amiga

The [**Amiga**](https://farm-ng.com/products/la-maquina-amiga) is
a platform of robotic hardware and software built by farm-ng to
enable farmers, hackers, engineers, roboticists, or anyone with a
vision of creating ruggedized, waterproof, outdoor robotic rover
applications.

The Amiga includes two main pieces, the Dashboard and the
artificial intelligence (AI) Brain.

### The Dashboard

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11846963/186734463-aa149b3a-7510-4d5a-99ea-f9a8a96775d2.jpg)

The Amiga robotics platform can operate under manual control
through the Dashboard which is the master control of the CAN Bus
commands and electricity flow to the motors. The Dashboard
consists of ruggedized and waterproof case with a 4.3 inch
daylight readable touchscreen display and is completely
customizable through our ADK (Amiga-Dev-Kit) tools. Inside is a
powerful microcontroller based on Adafruit's Feather m4 CAN,
which can be programmed via CircuitPython.

The Dashboard allows the user to manually set speed limits and
other system parameters as well as monitor system state
(temperature, speed, CAN Bus traffic etc). It has a pendant
connected to it which allows a stretchable wired interface to the
Amiga with a joystick for steering and speed, brake, pose and
control over any tools connected to and powered by the Amiga. An
emergency stop (E-Stop) knob is attached to the Dashboard to
allow users to instantly shut down the Amiga.

Farm-ng allows developers to create new tools or adapt existing
tools to the Amiga with an interface to extend electricity and
CAN bus control signals and even to add your own custom CAN bus
feather microcontroller. There are a number of standard farming
tools already available such as 3 Point Lifts, seats, plows,
seeders, weeders, dibblers etc,
see <https://farm-ng.com/collections/amiga-attachments>

### The Brain

The Amiga Brain allows the platform to run complex artificial
intelligence applications with a powerful computer encased in a
weatherized, rugged aluminum case sporting a daylight readable 10.
1 inch touch screen. Inside is a
[NVIDIA Xavier NX](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-nx/)
computer with up to 21 TOPS of performance. It includes CAN bus,
USB and GIGe communication along with built-in WiFi. The brain
allows a developer to write and deploy powerful AI applications
using standard Python. There are several example applications and
examples available at
<https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/examples/examples-index#brain-adk-examples>

Most Brain systems come with two
[Oak-D Smart Camera](https://farm-ng.com/products/amiga-smart-camera-kit)
which are powered by the system over ethernet and themselves can
run AI models at 4 TOPS in addition to stereo depth computations.

## Amiga OS

The Amiga Brain includes the **AmigaOS**, a robotics operating
system exclusively developed for the Amiga platform and for its
specific farming applications. The operating system is the one in
charge to manage the different supported devices, and interact
with the native or user provided.

Below you can see a couple of screenshots of the main layouts to
navigate through the different apps, settings pages, or access to
the developers tools.

### Microservices Architecture

The **AmigaOS** and therefore the SDK are designed following a
microservices architecture leveraging gRPC as a lightweight
protocol framework for message passing, and asyncio to
concurrently orchestrate the different services as independent
asynchronous tasks.

Below you can see a high level description of the Amiga OS
architecture, starting from the Amiga platform which is the
hardware layer, until the final user layer which are the GUI
apps. The connection in between happens thanks to the
[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) message passing framework.

### gRPC Services

The Amiga includes different core [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)
services that expose the basic sensors and intercommunication
within the robot. We expose to the user the services to interact
with the OAK-D cameras and the CAN bus used to receive the robot
telemetry and send the signal to the motors.

The way to access this data is using the Python Open Source
clients in the Python farm-ng-amiga package. We also provide
examples about how to use this either as a standalone Python
script, or as a [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) application.

Below is a snippet of the Python API to interact with the Oak
cameras:

## The native Apps

The AmigaOS provides some native apps to fulfill different needs
and requirements from a GUI perspective.

### Recorder

The recorder app is the tool we provide to collect data from the
GUI. It’s a replica of the camera apps that you can find in any
smartphone, but it records all the data (for example all CAN bus
messages) coming from the connected sensors and devices.

With this app you can customize the numbers of sensors to record
the data, adjust the camera parameters, and visualize in real
time from the different cameras modes e.g rgb, disparity or left/
right grayscale images.

In addition, we provide the open source library
(in Python and C++)
to decode the events file generated by the recorder. See:
<https://github.com/farm-ng/farm-ng-core>

### Gallery / Playback

With this app you can explore the different files collected with
the Recorder app and visualize in situ the collected data. In the
future we’ll provide more functionality to perform data
annotation e.g to train AI models. In addition, we also provide a
playback tool to visualize the video sequences at different speed
and seek frames.

### File mover

We provide a simple application so that you can copy in your
external drive all the data stored in the robot to perform later
any type of data analysis.

## Create custom apps

With the Amiga SDK we want to encourage anyone to create their
own applications and improve the development experience. For this
reason we provide an
[app-template](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template) in
github so that you can clone and start building your robotics
app, integrate with any Python library from your vs-code via ssh
directly in the robot (enjoying also the co-pilot).

You can follow this tutorial to start developing your Amiga apps:
