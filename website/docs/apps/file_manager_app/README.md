The File Manager app is crucial for efficiently
managing log files on your Amiga. With its user-friendly
design, this app equips users with the tools needed to manage recorded log files and
topic streams chosen in the [**Recorder**](/docs/apps/launcher/#recorder).
Its simplicity and ease of use make it an essential tool for handling these files effectively.

Log files are generated once a recording has been successfully initiated by pressing the
**RECORD** button on the navigation bar or the **Start Recording** button in the
[**Camera App**](/docs/apps/camera_app/).

### Manage Log Files

- **File Listing**: The app lists all log files stored
 on the robot, providing users with a clear view of available data.
- **File Details**: Each file carries a time stamp
and a file size, making it easier to gauge the data
 volume at a glance.

- **Delete**: Users can select and delete any log file.
This feature is particularly useful for
managing storage space and removing outdated or unnecessary data.

### Visualize Log Files

Log files can be viewed locally by selecting
 the checkbox next to the desired file and then
  pressing the open button. If the log file includes
   data from multiple camera streams, these can be
    chosen from the dropdown menu located at the
     upper left corner of the screen.

Transport controls enable you to move through image frames one by one or in multiples of ten.

### Transfer Files to USB Drive

- **USB Copy**: If a USB drive is plugged into the robot,
  users can easily copy log files from the
robot's storage to the USB drive.
This functionality enhances data portability and
facilitates easy sharing or backup of important logs.
