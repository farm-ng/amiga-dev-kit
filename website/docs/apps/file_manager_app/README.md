view of available data.

gauge the data volume at a glance.

### Manage Log Files

- **Delete**: Users can select and delete any log file.
This feature is particularly useful for managing storage space and removing outdated or unnecessary data.

robot's storage to the USB drive.
This functionality enhances data portability and facilitates easy sharing or backup of important logs.
