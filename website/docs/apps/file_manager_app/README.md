### Manage Log Files

- **Delete**: Users can select and delete any log file.
This feature is particularly useful for
managing storage space and removing outdated or unnecessary data.

### Transfer Files to USB Drive

- **USB Copy**: If a USB drive is plugged into the robot,
  users can easily copy log files from the
robot's storage to the USB drive.
This functionality enhances data portability and
facilitates easy sharing or backup of important logs.
