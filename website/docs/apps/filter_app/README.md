## Calibration

Calibrating your Amiga ensures that the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is accurately aligned
with the robot's frame, essential for precise navigation and operation.

### Why Calibrate?

- **Accuracy**: Proper calibration corrects any sensor biases and alignments,
ensuring sensor readings are accurate.
- **Performance**: Accurate sensor data is critical for effective task performance,
especially in autonomous navigation.
- **Maintenance**: Calibration is necessary when setting up your Amiga, after physical
modifications, or when environmental factors could have affected sensor readings.

### How to Calibrate?

1. **Check Calibration Status**: In the Filter App, look for the "Calibration Status" indicator.
If it shows as "Calibrated" with a recent date, no further action is needed unless you've encountered
issues that suggest recalibration is necessary.

2. **Begin Calibration**:

    a. Click "Recalibrate" if needed.

    b. Position the Amiga on flat ground, as indicated by the app's visual guide.

## Fine-Tuning Settings

Adjust GPS antenna offsets, track width, and wheelbase to tailor the Amiga's movement to
its operational environment and physical characteristics.

### Why Fine-Tune Settings?

- **Tailored Navigation**: Compensate for unique physical configurations.
- **Operational Precision**: More accurate settings lead to more precise path following.
- **Adaptability**: Adjust settings when changing operational environments or the robot's physical setup.

### How to Adjust Settings?

1. **Access Settings Panel**: Click the "Settings" gear icon in the Filter App.
