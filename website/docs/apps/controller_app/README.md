Before diving into this code, here's a quick heads-up on what you'll need to be familiar with:

1. **Python Programming**: It's important to have a good grasp of Python, especially with concepts
like `functions`, `loops`, and `classes`, since the example utilizes these fundamentals.
2. **Asynchronous Programming with asyncio**: Familiarity with Python's asyncio for writing concurrent
code using the `async/await` syntax.
3. **Image Processing with OpenCV**: Basic knowledge of the OpenCV library for handling and manipulating
image data, including functions like `imdecode`, `applyColorMap`, and `imshow`.
4. **[farm-ng Oak Service Overview](/docs/concepts/oak_service/)**:
This overview provides a base understanding of the gRPC service the client you create will connect to.
