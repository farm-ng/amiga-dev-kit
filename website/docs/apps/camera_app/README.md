# Camera App Guide

# Camera App Overview

The Camera App is your centralized solution for configuring oak cameras and monitoring real-time
imagery on your Amiga.
This intuitive application streamlines the process of camera configuration and data recording,
allowing for effortless customization and operation.

## Key Functionalities

### Real-Time Visualization

The app provides a live feed from each connected oak camera, allowing users to see exactly what the
camera sees.
This real-time visualization aids in making informed adjustments to camera settings for optimal
recording quality.

### Camera Configuration

Users have the flexibility to configure each oak camera individually.
The following settings can be adjusted directly within the app:

- **Exposure Time (ms)**: Control the duration of each frame's exposure to light.
- **ISO Value**: Adjust the camera's sensitivity to light.
- **Lens Position**: Fine-tune the focus of the camera lens to capture sharp images.

For convenience, users may also opt for:

- **Auto Exposure**: The camera automatically adjusts the exposure settings for the best image quality.
- **Auto Focus**: The camera will manage its focus settings to ensure clarity and detail in recorded
imagery.

### Direct Recording

Initiate data recording directly from the Camera App with the same efficacy as using the Recorder App.
This feature is particularly useful for capturing imagery data streams, like RGB, left, right, and
disparity views, without the need for additional configuration.

:::note
Recording from the Camera App is equivalent to recording from the Recorder App, however, the Recorder
App provides additional data streams such as GPS and canbus.

## Streamlined Interface

The Camera App interface is designed for ease of use:

- **Start/Stop Recording**: Simple controls to begin or end the recording session.
- **Settings Adjustment**: Quick access to camera settings, with sliders for manual adjustments and
checkboxes for automatic configurations.
- **Camera Selection**: Tabs for each oak device enable users to switch between different cameras effortlessly.

With its user-friendly design and comprehensive feature set, the Camera App is an indispensable tool
for anyone looking to maximize the capabilities of their Amiga robot's camera system.
