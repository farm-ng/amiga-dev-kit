# Developing Custom Applications

In this tutorial we will show you how to develop a custom [**Kivy**](https://kivy.org/) application for the Amiga Brain.

## Prerequisites

:::warning

Make sure that you have ssh access to the brain. If you don't have ssh access, please follow the [**SSH Access**](/docs/ssh) tutorial.

:::

## Create a new app repository

To create your own custom application navigate to the [**`amiga-app-template-kivy`**](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template-kivy) repository on GitHub.
:::tip
You need to be signed into your GitHub account to see the option:  `Use this template`.
:::


![Create a new templated repository](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5157099/205272492-356c1540-948e-43dc-8f60-8992caa8d511.gif)

Written instructions (same as video above):
1. Click on green *Use this template* button (top right) to create a new repository based on this repo
2. Fill out:
    - Owner: (your_username)
    - Repository Name: whatever-you-want
        - Should be between between 4-17 characters, and
        - Use underscores (_) or dashes (-) for separating words (no spaces!)
    -Select Public box
    -Click [Create repository from template]
Done!

Now that you are done creating your repository, let the development begin!! :))

## Cloning Repository onto Brain

These next steps will be a challenge the first few times.

:::info
Please refer to [**GitHub-101**](/docs/support/github-101#set-up-an-ssh-key) for specific instructions on creating an ssh key on your brain
:::

Once you have established [**SSH connection**](/docs/ssh) with your robot. Clone the repository in your root directory:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
```

### Project structure

We recommend using [**VS-code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) as the IDE for developing.

Once you have established SSH connection with the robot, on the VS-code home page, select "Open folder" and navigate to
the repository of your custom application.

On the left side of the screen, you should see:

```bash
YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/  # Root level of the project.
├── libs/ # Contains private libraries.
|   └── project_name/
|       ├── ops.py  # e.g a operators submodule
|       └── project_name_subpackage/
|           └── utils.py  # e.g a utilities submodule
├── src/ # Contains all code needed to run the main gui application.
|   ├── assets/  # Contains files needed to run the application
|   |   └── app_logo.png  # static images or images for buttons.
|   ├── res/  # Contains the layout files and UI strings.
|   |   └── main.kv  # main ui layout in Kivy languague
|   └── main.py  # Is the main entry point for the gui application.
├── test/  # Contains code for test of the private libs.
|   └── test_dummy.py  # sets of unit test.
├── install.sh
|    # The script to install the app on the brain.
├── uninstall.sh
|    # The script to uninstall the app from the brain.
├── manifest.json
|    # The file containing the metadata of the app to register it on the brain.
├── entry.sh
|    # The script to setup the project, create a virtual env. and install dependencies.
└── setup.cfg
    # The file containing the metadata of the package, including the name, versioning, etc. Learn more here: https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html

```

## Customizing manifest.json file

The manifest.json file is the bridge between your custom app and the brain.

There are three edits to be made to the file all in CAPS, in "name", "exec_cmd", "display_name"

```json
{
  "services": {
    "TEMPLATE_NAME": {
      "name": "TEMPLATE_NAME",
      "type": "app",
      "exec_cmd": "/mnt/managed_home/farm-ng-user-YOUR_USER_HERE/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME/entry.sh",
      "display_name": "APP NAME",
      "autostart": false
    }
  }
}
```
Begin by updating both instances of "TEMPLATE_NAME" to a unique name.
This name should not have spaces, we recommend using the same name as the repository name.

Both instances of "TEMPLATE_NAME" should be the same
    1. no spaces
    2. use of "-" or "_"

Second, "YOUR_USER_HERE" should be updated to the name of the user who initially installed the application.
This is the user name from fleet manager.

Finally, "APP NAME" to whatever you'd like for the brain to display for your custom app.

:::info
Example manifest.json
:::

```json
{
  "services": {
    "template-app": {
      "name": "template-app",
      "type": "app",
      "exec_cmd": "/mnt/managed_home/farm-ng-user-aoc/our-template-app/entry.sh",
      "display_name": "Template App",
      "autostart": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Add app to brain screen

To add your custom app to the app page on the barin, run the `install.sh` script.

```bash
./install.sh
```

You should now see your app on the brain screen.

If the manifest.json was correctly configured, after about 30 seconds the application will launch.

It takes some time because the virtual environment needs to install all the dependencies.

### Run from the command line

Alternatively, while developing, you can run your app from the terminal.

To do this, open a terminal and navigate to your cusom app directory

```bash
./entry.sh  # install and run
```
Using this method will also allow you to see file outputs in the terminal.
