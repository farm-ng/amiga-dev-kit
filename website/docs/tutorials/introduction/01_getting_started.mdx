# Developing Custom Applications

In this tutorial we will show you how to develop a custom [**Kivy**](https://kivy.org/) application for the Amiga Brain.

## Prerequisites

:::tip

Make sure that you have ssh access to the brain. If you don't have ssh access, please follow the [**SSH Access**](/docs/ssh) tutorial.

:::

## Create a new app

To create your own custom application navigate to the [**`amiga-app-template-kivy`**](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template-kivy) repository on GitHub.
:::tip
You need to be signed into your GitHub account to see the option:  `Use this template`.
:::


![Create a new templated repository](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5157099/205272492-356c1540-948e-43dc-8f60-8992caa8d511.gif)

:::info
For [**01 - Camera Streamer Tutorial**](/docs/tutorials/camera_streamer/01_template_starter.md) we assume the repository name `camera_tutorial`.

For [**02 - Virtual Joystick Tutorial**](/docs/tutorials/virtual_joystick/01_template_starter.md) we assume the repository name `virtual_joystick`.
:::
Written instructions (same as video above):
1. Click on green *Use this template* button (top right) to create a new repository based on this repo
2. Fill out:
    - Owner: (your_username)
    - Repository Name: whatever-you-want
        - Should be between between 4-17 characters, and
        - Use underscores (_) or dashes (-) for separating words (no spaces!)
    -Select Public box
    -Click [Create repository from template]
Done!

Now that you are done creating your repository, you have two options:

1. Work in your local workspace.
2. Work in a remote Remote-SSH session using in vs-code.

In both cases you will have to clone the repository you created above by following the commands below.

```bash
cd <to-your-base-directory>
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```

### Project structure

In vs-code, you can see the project structure on the left side in the `EXPLORER`:

Below are listed the most important components.

```bash
repository-name/  # Root level of the project.
├── libs/ # Contains private libraries.
|   └── project_name/
|       ├── ops.py  # e.g a operators submodule
|       └── project_name_subpackage/
|           └── utils.py  # e.g a utilities submodule
├── src/ # Contains all code needed to run the main gui application.
|   ├── assets/  # Contains files needed to run the application
|   |   └── app_logo.png  # static images or images for buttons.
|   ├── res/  # Contains the layout files and UI strings.
|   |   └── main.kv  # main ui layout in Kivy languague
|   └── main.py  # Is the main entry point for the gui application.
├── test/  # Contains code for test of the private libs.
|   └── test_dummy.py  # sets of unit test.
├── install.sh
|    # The script to install the app on the brain.
├── uninstall.sh
|    # The script to uninstall the app from the brain.
├── manifest.json
|    # The file containing the metadata of the app to register it on the brain.
├── entry.sh
|    # The script to setup the project, create a virtual env. and install dependencies.
└── setup.cfg
    # The file containing the metadata of the package, including the name, versioning, etc. Learn more here: https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html

```

## Brain setup

The following commands will compile on the brain from an un-modified clone or template of this repository.
If there are problems with running these scripts, please try to clone the repository once again.

### Run from the command line

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned the [**amiga-app-template-kivy**](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template-kivy) repository.

```bash
cd <to-your-app-directory>
DISPLAY=:0 ./entry.sh  # install and run
```

If all goes well, you'll see an dummy Kivy application on your brain screen.

### Add custom app to brain screen

To add your custom app to the app page on the barin, run the `install.sh` script.

```bash
cd <to-your-app-directory>
./install.sh
```

You should now see your app on the brain screen. Click on it to launch it.
