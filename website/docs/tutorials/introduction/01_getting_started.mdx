# Developing Custom Applications

In this tutorial we will show you how to develop a custom [**Kivy**](https://kivy.org/) application for the Amiga Brain.

## Prerequisites

:::tip

Make sure that you have ssh access to the brain. If you don't have ssh access, please follow the [**SSH Access**](/docs/ssh) tutorial.

:::

## Create a new app repository

To create your own custom application navigate to the [**`amiga-app-template-kivy`**](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template-kivy) repository on GitHub.
:::tip
You need to be signed into your GitHub account to see the option:  `Use this template`.
:::

Written instructions (same as video above):
1. Click on green *Use this template* button (top right) to create a new repository based on this repo
2. Fill out:
    - Owner: (your_username)
    - Repository Name: whatever-you-want
        - Should be between between 4-17 characters, and
        - Use underscores (_) or dashes (-) for separating words (no spaces!)
    -Select Public box
    -Click [Create repository from template]
Done!

Now that you are done creating your repository, let the development begin!! :))

## Cloning Repository onto Brain

These next steps will be a challenge the first few times.

If you don't already have VsCode installed, begind by downloading it to your computer.

:::note
Download [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
:::

VsCode is a very powerful tool and we recommend reading through some of their docs.


Once you have established [**SSH connection**](/docs/ssh) with your robot. Clone the repository in your root directory:



```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```
:::info
If you are unfamiliar with git phrases such as 'push' and 'pull' we recommend reading over our [**Github 101**](/docs/support/github-101)
:::


### Project structure

We recommend using [**VS-code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) as the IDE for developing.

Once you have established SSH connection with the robot, on the VS-code home page, select "Open folder" and navigate to
the repository of your custom application.

On the left side of the screen, you should see:

```bash
repository-name/  # Root level of the project.
├── libs/ # Contains private libraries.
|   └── project_name/
|       ├── ops.py  # e.g a operators submodule
|       └── project_name_subpackage/
|           └── utils.py  # e.g a utilities submodule
├── src/ # Contains all code needed to run the main gui application.
|   ├── assets/  # Contains files needed to run the application
|   |   └── app_logo.png  # static images or images for buttons.
|   ├── res/  # Contains the layout files and UI strings.
|   |   └── main.kv  # main ui layout in Kivy languague
|   └── main.py  # Is the main entry point for the gui application.
├── test/  # Contains code for test of the private libs.
|   └── test_dummy.py  # sets of unit test.
├── install.sh
|    # The script to install the app on the brain.
├── uninstall.sh
|    # The script to uninstall the app from the brain.
├── manifest.json
|    # The file containing the metadata of the app to register it on the brain.
├── entry.sh
|    # The script to setup the project, create a virtual env. and install dependencies.
└── setup.cfg
    # The file containing the metadata of the package, including the name, versioning, etc. Learn more here: https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html

```

## Brain setup

Once you are able to see the file tree on the left side of the VS-code window. There are a few final steps
to show the app on the screen.

### Update manifest.json
In the file tree, you should see a file named, manifest.json.

The file is the bridge between your custom app and the brain.

There are three edits to be made to the file, in "name", "exec_cmd", "display_name"

```json
{
  "services": {
    "example-app-kivy": {
      "name": "example-app-kivy",
      "type": "app",
      "exec_cmd": "/mnt/managed_home/farm-ng-user-YOUR_USER_HERE/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/entry.sh",
      "display_name": "Kivy Example App",
      "autostart": false
    }
  }
}
```
Both instances of TEMPLATE_NAME should be the same
    1. no spaces
    2. use of "-" or "_"

farm-ng-user-YOUR_USER_NAME

Begin by updating both instances of TEMPLATE_NAME to a unique name.
This name should not have spaces, we recommend using the same name as the repository name.

Second, "YOUR_USER_HERE" should be updated to the name of the user who initially installed the application.
This is the user name from fleet manager.

Update "display_name" to whatever you'd like for the brain to display

### Add custom app to brain screen

To add your custom app to the app page on the barin, run the `install.sh` script.

```bash
cd <to-your-app-directory>
./install.sh
```

You should now see your app on the brain screen. Click on it to launch it.

### Run from the command line

Alternatively, while developing, you can run your app from the terminal.

To do this, open a terminal and navigate to your cusom app directory

```bash
DISPLAY=:0 ./entry.sh  # install and run
```
