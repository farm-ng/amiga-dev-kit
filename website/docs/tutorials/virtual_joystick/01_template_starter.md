# Template Starter

## Set up your Amiga brain template

Follow the instructions in [**Developing Custom Applications**](/docs/brain/custom-applications.mdx)
to clone and set up an application from the
[**amiga-app-template**](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template).

Be sure not to skip the
[**Customizing an app**](/docs/brain/brain-apps#customizing-an-app)
required to properly configure
the library and app you are creating.

:::tip
Feel free to choose any repository name, but it's recommended to
go with something like `joystick_tutorial` for the repository.
That difference will make it easier to differentiate between the
[**`farm-ng/virtual-joystick`**](https://github.com/farm-ng/virtual-joystick)
example and your own implementation if they both get cloned onto
the same machine.

We will assume you went with `joystick_tutorial` in this tutorial.
:::

## Rename the `TemplateApp`

Now that you've created the template, it's time to rename it for
your app.
In this tutorial, we'll go with `VirtualJoystickApp`.

Navigate to `main.py` in your app and open it with a text editor.

:::tip
We recommend [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)!
:::

There's 3 places to change the templated name:

```Python
# 1. Rename the class
class VirtualJoystickApp(App):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()

...

# 2. Rename the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog="joystick-tutorial")

...

# 3. Run with the new class name
try:
    loop.run_until_complete(VirtualJoystickApp().app_func())
except asyncio.CancelledError:
    pass
```

### Run the app - template

Now sync the app to the Brain and launch it with the
[**Deploy Instructions**](/docs/brain/brain-apps#develop-and-test-in-the-robot)
for syncing the app onto the Amiga Brain!

After the requirements install, you should see the template kivy
app pop up.
Try out the `Back` button to exit the app.
