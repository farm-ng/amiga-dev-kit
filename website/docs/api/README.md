There are two distinct, yet compatible, APIs.

## Microcontroller API

This is the API of the farm-ng microcontroller development kit and is used in the
[**Microcontroller Examples**](/docs/examples/examples-index#microcontroller-examples).

This is [**CircuitPython**](https://circuitpython.org/) and is
for running directly on micro-controllers,
like the [**farm-ng microcontroller kit**](/docs/mcu_kit/README.mdx).
If you intend to use your own micro-controller or computer to
interact directly with the Amiga through the CAN bus, you should use this API.

## Brain API

This is the API of the farm-ng Brain development kit and is used in the
[**Brain ADK Examples**](/docs/examples/examples-index#brain-adk-examples).

This is for running directly on the
[**farm-ng Brain**](/docs/intelligence-kit/brain/brain-v2/)
or for interacting with the gRPC services running on the brain
from another computer.
