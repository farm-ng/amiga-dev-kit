**Joystick** (omni directional stick that is used to control the
amiga. This controls include, Acceleration, and turning left and
right, reverse)

**Cruise(X)** â€“ this will allow you to place your Amiga into
cruise control. To activate this,while the amiga is completely
stopped, press `cruise` then gently push forward the joystick to
accelerate, pull back on joystick to decrease acceleration. You
can press this button once more to exit cruise control and slow
to a stop.

:::caution
Pushing forward and pulling back on the joystick does not control
speed, only acceleration and how much it will accelerate in
relation to the set speed on the dashboard home tab.
:::

**Brake(O)**
This is a brake for the Amiga. Pressing this will stop all motors
and exit cruise control mode (if active).

**PTO (Triangle)**
Power take-off (PTO) is a device that transfers an engine's
mechanical power to another piece of equipment. A PTO allows the
hosting energy source to transmit power to additional equipment
that does not have its own engine or motor.

We use this to facilitate control from the pendant for addition
equipment attached to the Amiga, such as the
[**3-point lift**](https://farm-ng.com/products/cat-zero-3-point-lift-kit),
[**compost spreader**](https://farm-ng.com/products/compost-spreader) or
[**cargo dump box**](https://farm-ng.com/products/kit-cargo-dump-box)

**PAUSE(Square)**
Currently this button is a free button to be updated in future
firmware releases.

**ARROWS** -  UP, Down, Left, Right (these are used to control
your connect and registered PTO device).

[**FAQ page**](../reference/faq)
