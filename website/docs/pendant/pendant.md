**Joystick** (omni directional stick that is used to control the amiga. This controls include, Acceleration, and turning left and right, reverse)

:::tip
Indicators include: Brighter light over the icon, on MC tab, cruise control will be highlighted)
:::

**Cruise(X)** – this will allow you to place your Amiga into cruise control. Press this button while the amiga is completely stopped. To activate this, press `cruise` then gently push forward the joystick to accelerate, pull back on joystick to decrease acceleration

:::caution
pushing forward and pulling back on the joystick does not control speed, only acceleration and how much it will accelerate in relation to the set speed on the dashboard home tab.
:::

**Brake(O)** – this is an emergency brake for the MCUs, pressing this will end cruise control and stop all motors

**PTO (Triangle)**

**PAUSE(Square)**
**ARROWS** -  UP, Down, Left, Right {these are used to control your connect and registered PTO device)
 Basic troubleshooting (can be on FAQ page)
