## Charging you Amiga

Each Amiga typically comes with 2 batteries and 2 chargers. Additional batteries and ways to
connect extra batteries on the same robot are available at our online shop.

To charge your batteries, remove them from the robot, lift the handle and connect the
charger. You will notice the LED in your charging brick will turn RED while the battery is
charging and GREEN when done.

Your charger can output power at 2 A (max), which will charge your 15 Ah in around 6 hours.

Alternatively, you can charge your batteries directly in your Amiga connecting it to one of the
spare Anderson connectors located inside the forks.

Any 50+ VDC 2+ A charger can be modified to be used as an in-vehicle charging. At Farm-ng we use a
50.4VDC 5A unit that can be purchased at our store. The important is to know that the batteries
will charge at max peak voltage of 50.4 VDC, not to be confused with the nominal battery voltage
(48 V).

Similar to the standard charger, a 5A charger will charge both your batteries in around 5 hours,

In order for in-vehicle charging to work, you need to keep your batteries ON (keys parallel to
ground).

## Battery Fuses

To protect all circuits in your Amiga, all batteries are equipped with a fuse located on its side
close to the power output connector. The fuse must be 30 Amp, Slow blow, and we recommend using
ceramic fuses.
Remove it using a phillips screwdriver.

:::tip pro tip
When you battery is not supplying any voltage to the robot, it is likely due to a blown fuse.
Verify its integrity before you proceed with your troubleshooting process.
