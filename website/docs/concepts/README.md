## Fundamental Concepts

Please start with the Fundamental Concepts,
especially the [Amiga Development 101 guide](/docs/concepts/system_overview)
that provides an overview of "**Services**" on your brain and their interactions.

## Service Overviews

We provide overviews of each service running on your brain and high-level instructions
for interacting with them.

:::tip
These overviews are useful context before going through the related
[Brain ADK Examples](/docs/examples/examples-index#brain-adk-examples).
