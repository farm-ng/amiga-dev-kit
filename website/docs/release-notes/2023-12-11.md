We're excited to announce the launch of AmigaOS 2.1 “Clementine,” a significant update packed with
enhancements and optimizations for the Amiga.
This release refines the experience and fortifies the platform with a suite of new features for
both everyday users and developers.

## Data Collection

* **Camera Preview and Control**: Introducing a brand-new [Camera app](/docs/apps/camera_app/)
  designed for live streaming and recording, complete with a user-friendly settings management
  interface.

* **Copy to USB**: With automatic USB drive mounting and a redesigned
  [File Manager](/docs/apps/file_manager_app/), conveniently move your data logs for offboard
  analysis and manage your disk space.

## Developer Experience

* **Custom Kivy Apps**: Back by popular demand, AmigaOS 2.1 now supports custom application
  development with [Kivy](https://kivy.org/). We've ported the beloved AmigaOS 1.0 Artichoke
  [Kivy examples](/docs/brain/brain-apps-kivy) to the sleek and efficient AmigaOS 2.1 Clementine
  environment, ensuring your favorite custom apps run smoother than ever.
  :::tip
  If you are porting an existing Kivy app from AmigaOS 1.0, then check out our
  [migration guide](/docs/brain/sdk-barley-migration)!

* **Expanded Documentation**: Dive into our updated guides with examples on
  [plotting tracks](/docs/examples/track_plotter/),
  [registering custom apps](/docs/brain/brain-apps-manifest) with the Brain launcher UI, and
  understanding the intricacies of the manifest for seamless service/app integration.

* **Performance Metrics**: Gain deeper insights into your Amiga's performance with real-time
metrics on memory usage and CPU load, allowing you to optimize your operations.

## Autonomy Improvements

* **Autoplot App Enhancements**: We've squashed bugs that previously hindered the app experience.
Breadcrumbs now display correctly, the app no longer crashes or delays when selecting a track, and
recording a new track is flawless, even at high speeds.
* **Enhanced GPS Functionality**: Our improved GPS service now automatically reconnects to a base
station, ensuring uninterrupted, precise geolocation capabilities.

## System Performance

* **UI Responsiveness**: We've optimized our launcher UI on the Brain display, delivering you a
  snappier interface and smoother interactions across the board.
* **OTA Updates**: The updater service now calculates deltas more efficiently and will reuse data
  fetched during a previously aborted download, for quicker and more reliable updates.
