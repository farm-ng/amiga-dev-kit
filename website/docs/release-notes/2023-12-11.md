We're excited to announce the launch of AmigaOS 2.1 “Clementine”, a significant update packed with
enhancements and optimizations for the Amiga.
This release refines the user experience, expands documentation, and fortifies the platform with a
suite of new features for both everyday users and developers.

## Major Improvements

* **Autoplot App Enhancements**: We've squashed bugs that previously hindered the app experience.
Breadcrumbs now display correctly, the app no longer crashes or delays when selecting a track, and
recording a new track is flawless, even at high speeds.

to the sleek and efficient OS 2.1 Clementine environment, ensuring your favorite custom apps run
smoother than ever.

## User Interface and Experience

* **Data Collection Made Easy**: Introducing a brand-new Camera app designed for live streaming and
recording, complete with a user-friendly settings management interface.
* **Disk Management**: With automated USB drive mounting and a redesigned File Manager, managing your
storage needs has never been more intuitive.
* **UI Responsiveness**: Experience the difference with our integration of FastAPI and React,
delivering you a snappier interface and smoother interactions across the board.

## Developer-Focused Enhancements

* **Expanded Documentation**: Dive into our updated guides with examples on plotting tracks,
adding custom apps to the brain launcher, and understanding the intricacies of the manifest
for seamless service/app integration.
* **Performance Metrics**: Gain deeper insights into your Amiga's performance with real-time
metrics on memory usage and CPU load, allowing you to optimize your operations.

## GPS Capability

* **Enhanced GPS Functionality**: Our improved GPS service now automatically reconnects to a base
station, ensuring uninterrupted, precise geolocation capabilities.
