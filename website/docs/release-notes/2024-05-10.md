We are thrilled to announce the launch of AmigaOS 2.3 "Elderberry"!
This release marks a significant evolution in our software, with major updates aimed at enhancing performance,
user interaction, and integration capabilities. From a robust Rust backbone to advanced teleoperation
features, every update brings you closer to seamless automation.

## Core Updates

* **Rust Implementation**
  * We've transitioned many of our core services from Python to Rust,
  significantly improving resource utilization and CPU performance.
  This foundational upgrade ensures a faster, more reliable system.

## Real-Time Communication

* **WebRTC**
  * Introducing real-time streaming capabilities with WebRTC! Enjoy high-quality,
  low-latency video streams directly from your Amiga,
  enhancing both user experience and operational efficiency.

## Digital Twin

* **Web-Based Access**
  * Access a perfect digital twin of your Amiga through any web browser.
  Simply enter `<robot-name/ip-address>/` to interact with your robot in real-time,
  providing a seamless interface for monitoring and control.

## Tool Control

* **Enhanced Device Management**
  * Take control of h-bridges and PTOs directly through the Autoplot app.
  Our new "Tool Control" panel, accessible via a dedicated button,
  displays all connected tools and provides user-friendly controls for operation.

## Teleoperation

* **8-BitDo Controller Integration**
  * Enhanced teleoperation capabilities allow you to control your Amiga and
  its tools using an 8-BitDo controller.
  This update brings precision and ease to your hands, making operations smoother than ever.

## Enhanced GPS

* **NMEA GGA Message Integration**
  * Our GPS service now streams NMEA GGA messages back to the base station,
  allowing for seamless integration with third-party service providers and enhancing
  your geo-location capabilities.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to refine and expand the capabilities of AmigaOS!

Happy automating from the Amiga Brain Team!
