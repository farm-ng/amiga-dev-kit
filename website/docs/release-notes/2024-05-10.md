We are thrilled to announce the launch of AmigaOS 2.3 "Elderberry"!
This release marks a significant evolution in our software, with major updates aimed at enhancing performance,
user interaction, and integration capabilities. From a robust Rust backbone to advanced teleoperation
features, every update brings you closer to seamless automation.

## Core Updates

* **Rust Implementation**
  * We've transitioned many of our core services from Python to Rust,
  significantly improving resource utilization, CPU performance and logging robustness.
  This foundational upgrade ensures a faster, more reliable system.

* **Improved boot up time**
  * We've significantly reduced the time it takes to boot up the brain.

## Autonomy & Teleoperation

* **Real-time video streaming**
  * Introducing real-time streaming capabilities with WebRTC! Enjoy high-quality,
  low-latency video streams directly from your Amiga,
  enhancing both user experience and operational efficiency.

* **Colorful images**
  * Introducing both RGB and mono images.
  Get vivid details and sharp definition of the RGB images on the oak devices.
  Use the night-mode (mono images) for an extended view of the robot's surroundings
  and better visualization in low-light environments.

* **Tool Control**
  * Take control of h-bridges and PTOs directly through the Autoplot app.
  Our new "Tool Control" panel, accessible via a dedicated button,
  displays all connected tools and provides user-friendly controls for operation.

* **Teleoperation**
  * Enhanced teleoperation capabilities allow you to control your Amiga and
  its tools using an 8-BitDo controller.
  This update brings precision and ease to your hands, making operations smoother than ever.

## Enhanced User Experience

* **Digital Twin**
  * Access a perfect digital twin of your Amiga through any web browser.
  Simply enter `<robot-name/ip-address>/` (e.g., `http://aluminum-pineapple.tail0be07.ts.net/` or
  `http://100.128.162.1.1/`) to interact with your robot in real-time,
  providing a seamless interface for monitoring and control.

* **App Bar everywhere**
  * Enjoy a more functional and interactive app bar everywhere in brain.
  * Both the GPS and Filter icons are now clickable, and will provide important
  logs that are helpful for troubleshooting, such as
  [Divergence Reasons](add-link-to-page).
  * Enjoy the new `RECORD` button on the app bar.
  Use it to start/stop recording logs from anywhere in the brain.

* **Fast app switching**
  * Enjoy improved times for opening and closing apps.

* **Revamped Launcher**
  * We have created a `Settings` menu to allow users to make in depth adjustments to
  the various systems of the Amiga.
  * The `Filter`, `GPS`, and `Recorder` apps were moved into Settings to keep the launcher apps
  more concise.
  * Moreover, users can now control parameters of the filter and track follower services.
  * New PoE Switch Manager, useful for network diagnostic capabilities, including the ability to
  detect potential cabling issues.

* **Preview images on log files**
  * We have added a preview functionality to the `File Manager` app.
  * If an image is part of your log, you can now preview it directly on the brain
  before saving it to a USB flash drive.

* **Enhanced Wifi Manager**
  * Forget networks
  * Turn wifi on/off for troubleshooting
  * Quickly connect to known networks without typing in a password

## Enhanced GPS

* **NMEA GGA Message Integration**
  * Our GPS service now streams NMEA GGA messages back to the base station,
  allowing for seamless integration with third-party service providers and enhancing
  your geo-location capabilities.

## Lots of new open source examples

* Enjoy lots of new open-source examples.
From tool control to track planning.
