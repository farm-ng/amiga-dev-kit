We're excited to announce the launch of AmigaOS 2.2 “Dragon Fruit!” This is a
usability-focused release improving the experience for large-scale data collection,
custom application development, and teach-and-repeat autonomy using Autoplot.

## Data Collection

We've extended our suite of data collection apps with power features for large-scale
collections.

* **Camera**
  * Improved UX for adjusting OAK-D camera settings.
* **Recorder**
  * Store user-defined metadata (key/value pairs) in log files, such as field name, crop
    type, or whatever else is relevant to your collection needs!
  * Split large logs into multiple chunks with a maximum file size for easier transfer.
* **File Manager**
  * Preview images and inspect metadata in log files.
  * Support multiple USB drives.

## Developer Experience

* New and updated documentation for
  [troubleshooting custom apps](/docs/brain/brain-apps#debugging-the-app-on-the-launcher),
  the [microcontroller API](/docs/api/#farm-ng-microcontroller-adk), and debugging
  [dashboard error codes](/docs/dashboard/dashboard-debugging).
* More robust registration of custom apps with the launcher UI.
* The custom app template now demonstrates using an app-specific virtualenv, so that
  you can add additional Python packages without relying on system installs.
  :::tip
  As part of this change, the `python` manifest option has been removed, and you must
  use `exec_cmd` to specify how to run your application. See the example
  [manifest.json](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template/blob/main/manifest.json).

## Autonomy

* While recording a track in Autoplot, you can now pause recording, delete the last
  waypoint(s), and resume recording. You can quickly fix errors without starting the
  whole track over!
* Improved reporting when autonomy is unavailable.
  * If any preconditions for autonomous track following are not met, the "Start
     Following" button will pop up an explanation.
  * For developers, if the filter diverges, the reason is recorded in the `FilterState` proto.
