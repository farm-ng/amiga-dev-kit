# AmigaOS 2.3.1 - Patch Release Notes

## Bug Fixes

- **JPEG Stream Quality**
  - Restored image quality of recording JPEG streams to parity with version 2.2.1.
  This fixes a regression in 2.3.0 that could cause noticeable compression artifacts.

- **Multiple Camera Recording**
  - Fixed the ability to record all topics from up to 4 OAK cameras simultaneously,
  ensuring comprehensive data capture.

- **Date/Time Tracking**
  - The Brain now accurately tracks the correct date and time across power-offs,
  even when it does not have access to Wi-Fi for NTP updates.

## New Features

- **Recorder Profiles**
  - Users can now create and edit profiles for recording data streams from the robot.
  This feature is particularly useful for customized data collection needs, allowing for
  greater flexibility in recording configurations.
