# AmigaOS 2.3.1 - Patch Release Notes

## Bug Fixes

- **JPEG Stream Quality**
  - Restored image quality of recording JPEG streams to parity with version 2.2.1.
  This fixes a regression in 2.3.0 that could cause noticeable compression artifacts.

- **Multiple Camera Recording**
  - Fixed the ability to record all topics from up to 4 OAK cameras simultaneously,
  ensuring comprehensive data capture.

- **Date/Time Tracking**
  - The Brain now accurately tracks the correct date and time across power-offs,
  even when it does not have access to Wi-Fi for NTP updates.

## New Features

- **Recorder Profiles**
  - Users can now create and edit profiles for recording data streams from the robot.
  This feature is particularly useful for customized data collection needs, allowing for
  greater flexibility in recording configurations.

- **CAN Status and Error States**
  - The app bar now displays CAN status and error states, providing users with real-time
  diagnostics and improving overall system transparency and troubleshooting capabilities.

## Breaking Changes

- **Timestamps**
  - Some events have additional timestamps. Note which one to use for backwards compatibility.
  While it is possible to retrieve event stamps by indexing them by order, we strongly recommend
  you to do so by `semantics` and `clock type`.

  For context, the available semantics can be found in [farm-ng-core: stamp.py](https://github.com/farm-ng/farm-ng-core/blob/main/py/farm_ng/core/stamp.py).

  The available clock times are:

  - **Monotonic**: A clock that cannot go backwards and is not affected by changes to the system clock.
  It is used to measure intervals with a constant rate, making it ideal for timing events and ensuring
  that elapsed time measurements are reliable.
  - **System Clock/UTC**: The system clock, also known as the UTC clock, represents the current time
  as per the systemâ€™s calendar.
  It is subject to adjustments and changes (e.g., daylight saving time), and it is used to track
  real-world date and time.

  :::note
  While we have multiple semantics, not every event will have all semantics or clock types.
  We tend to use the `monotonic` clock for `driver/receive` events, as it is the one consistently available.

Stay tuned for more updates and improvements! As always, we welcome your feedback to continue
refining the AmigaOS experience.

Happy coding :sunglasses: from the Amiga Brain Team!
