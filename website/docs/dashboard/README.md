## Description

Farm-ng's Dashboard is a ruggedized, waterproof, outdoor-visible touch-screen display and machine controller - customizable through our ADK (Amiga-Dev-Kit) toolset!

Under the hood is a simple yet powerful embedded microcontroller based on Adafruit's Feather M4 CAN, which runs CircuitPython and makes building your own custom interfaces as simple as connecting a USB cable and writing a few lines of code.  If you've been looking for a microcontroller and display that can handle harsh environments, look no further!

The Dashboard comes with a Wifi modem and CANbus transceiver on board, and is powered over an industrial M12 connector compatible with the Amiga.  Includes debug cable.
