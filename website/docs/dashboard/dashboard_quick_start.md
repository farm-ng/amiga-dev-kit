## Main Screen
*insert picture/ gif of home screen
This is the main screen of the dashboard. This screen will appear when you first turn on the Amiga. “Ready” or “listo” will appear and once you touch the button you will be taken to the home screen

Alternatively if you receive this page, this means that either you have defective pendant or your pendant needs to be calibrated.
If your pendant is not being detected at all and if it says `No Pendant Detected` please contact the Farm-ng Support immediately.

:::tip
you can check this in the pendant section of the Settings tab.

## Home Screen
Insert screen shot or gif

This is the home screen of the dashboard. On this screen you will find:
- The speedometer
- A preview of motor health
- Average motor temperature
- Battery levels of the amiga

## Motor Status Screen
This screen for monitoring each motor in much more detail than that of the home screen. On this screen you can:
- monitor the control state of the motors,
- their individual temperature,
- CAN state

## Auto Control Screen
On this screen, is where the autonomous control of the amiga comes to life. Here you will be able to :
- Enable and disable Auto Control
- Monitor the state
- Monitor the speed and turn radius of the amiga while in this state

If you have a brain, here is where you will be able to use the virtual joystick to control your Amiga.

## Settings Tab

Now we have the settings tab, which may be the most important tab. Here on the settings tab you have a few options. Here you can find:
- The general settings for the amiga
- The pendant settings
- Advanced settings
- H-bridge settings
- PTO(power take-off) settings
- ID settings
