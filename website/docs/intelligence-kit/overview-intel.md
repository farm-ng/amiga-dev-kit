The Amiga Intelligence Kit is a comprehensive system designed for developers
and researchers seeking to add to their Amiga's capabilities for exploration,
data collection and more.

## What's Included

### Brain

The farm-ng Brain brings supercomputer performance to the edge in a
ruggedized package designed for the harshest environments.
The Brain with a NVIDIA Xavier NX offers up to 21 TOPS,
while the Brain with a NVIDIA Orin NX offers up to 100 TOPS of
hardware-accelerated computing power for machine learning and AI applications.

### RTK GPS

The kit includes a dual-band GPS antenna that connects directly to the Brain,
along with an RTK-capable GPS module located within the Brain and
linked to the GPS antenna via an SMA connector.
This RTK GPS can deliver centimeter-level location information for real-time
positioning and navigation applications when combined with a RTK base station.

of our GPS module.

**NOTE**: To receive RTK corrections, the robot must be connected to a RTK base station.
Make sure to read the [requirements of our GPS service](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/concepts/gps_service/#requirements)
to know more.

### Cameras

The kit includes a pair of high quality waterproof Luxonis OAK-D cameras in
ruggedized cases.
These cameras use Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) for communication and power,
ensuring a stable and efficient connection.
The M12 X-Coded Ethernet to A-coded cable connectors are designed for secure
and reliable connection.

### PoE Switch

This device allows you to connect the Cameras, Brain and
RTK-GPS module to the Amiga.
It includes 6 ports to allow connection of 4 smart cameras.

### Additional Hardware

1. Debug Cable
2. Mast Hardware
3. Protective Case
