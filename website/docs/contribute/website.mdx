# Getting started

This page contains instructions for developers who want to contribute to the Amiga Development Kit documentation.

We build our website with [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) with Markdown syntax.
To get started:

1. Clone the [Amiga Development Kit repo](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit)
```bash
git clone git@github.com:farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit.git
```
2. Create a branch based on `main` and open a pull request with your proposed improvements.
  - Reach out to us on the [farm-ng Discord channel](https://discord.gg/YTCyGsEtBU) if you need help or support on this.
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b your-new-branch
git push -u origin your-new-branch
```
3. Follow the instructions below for building the docs locally so you can see your changes in real time!

:::tip
If you aren't familiar with Markdown syntax, check out one of the many getting started guides available free online.
Such as [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

# Building these Docs
In order to work locally on your machine and contribute to these docs, you will need to install the build infrastructure.

:::caution
You can edit the documentation directly on github and do not need to fuss with things here!
Follow instructions below for adding images to the website, it's the same for text.
:::

## Installation

Docusaurus allows you to build the docs locally and inspect how the website will appear, before actually deploying.

In order to use docusaurus locally you'll need to install a couple libraries:
- Node.js version 16.14 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`)
- Yarn >= 1.22.19

We recommend doing so in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages / versions installed on your system.
Though this is not a requirement and you are welcome to decide how/where to install.

Install `pip3` & `virtualenv` (system level):

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```
Start a virtual environment:

```bash
cd amiga-dev-kit/ # or anywhere you want your `venv` to exist
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

You can exit your virtualenv with:

```bash
deactivate
```

And re-enter from the root where the venv was created (e.g., `amiga-dev-kit`) with:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>
Install NVM / nodejs

```bash
sudo apt update
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc

# Verify install
nvm --version

# Install node
nvm install node
```

Install yarn

```bash
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install -g yarn

# Check version
yarn --version
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="MacOs">
Install npm

```bash
brew install npm
```

Install yarn

```bash
brew install yarn
# yes, use a package manager to install a package manager... ;)
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>



## Adding images to the website

:::info
If you are already working in an active branch, this process works for branched versions of markdown files.
If you are not, you will be prompted to create a new branch with your edits (to open a pull request) or commit the edits directly.
:::

We want to keep this repository as lightweight as possible.
For this reason, please do not add any images to the filesystem of this repository.
If you'd like to add an image, you should edit the README
online through Github by:

1. Press the edit button in the top right corner of the markdown file
2. Drag & drop an image into the markdown file you are editing.
3. A link to the image should be automatically generated and formattedin the markdown file.

The generated link should look something like: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11846963/185976402-ff8c4c77-5a08-42b0-865f-d2840fc0b960.jpg

:::caution
If you are also editing the file locally, you should add the image to the branch you are actively editing.
Recommend committing your changes before adding the image to avoid merge conflicts, and using `git pull` to pull in the changes to your local branch before continuing to edit.
:::

:::tip farm-ng employees
Please back up the images you add to the website in the `Website/Assets/` directory of our shared drive.
:::

## Local Development
After successful installation and working in the amiga-dev-kit github repo, you'll be able to pull down the latest, create a branch, and send pull requests just as you would editing any repo.

After making your edits, you will build the docs locally in order to preview them before committing and pushing.  Following the steps below,
you would be able to start a local development server that opens a browser window and gives you a live preview of the page you are editing!  It will automatically update every time you save.


### Building the docs
```bash
cd website/  # /farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit/website
pip install -r requirements.txt
yarn
./run_pydoc-markdown.sh
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Start yarn

```bash
yarn start
```

:::info
This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Gussy up your Markdown
:::tip
You can make your work more legible using [admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions) like this TIP box!
:::
More markdown features can be found in the docusaurus documentation [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

## Pre-commit formatting workflow

:::caution
You may need to install pre-commit, instructions can be found [here](https://pre-commit.com/)
:::

A typical workflow for committing your code changes may look like this:

```bash
git add -p # Add the changes I want
pre-commit run --all-files
git add -p # Add the formatting changes the check just fixed
pre-commit run --all-files # double check for any formatting issues not resolved automatically (e.g., spellcheck)
git commit -m "foo bar baz"
git push
```
