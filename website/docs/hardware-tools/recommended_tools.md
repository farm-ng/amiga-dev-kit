We've started work on a thorough list the tools you'll want to have on hand for hacking on robotics hardware. Found at:

## Scissor lift

A great way to develop with the Amiga, especially when working on control applications, is to put it up on a scissor lift.
This way you can test measuring wheel odometry, controlling the robot, and more without concern of running into anything or pulling out any cables you may have connected.

We tend to use double scissor lifts, with a 770 lb capacity.
But what's most important is that the table is long enough to lift the amiga from both crossbars.

- In the past, we've run to Home Depot and purchased: [Eoslift 770 lb double scissor lift](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Eoslift-Industrial-Grade-Heavy-Duty-TAD35-Manual-Double-Scissor-Lift-Table-Cart-770-lbs-Cap-20-5-in-x-39-7in-Swivel-Casters-TAD35/301884311
)
- And we've ordered from Uline: [Uline 770 lb double scissor lift](
