# Recommended Tools

## Basic recommended tool kit for hardware hacking

:::caution Work in Progress
We're working on putting together a compact, yet exhaustive, list
of
the tools you'll want to have on hand for hacking on robotics
hardware.

In the meantime, we hope this can serve as inspiration for what
you
ought to have on hand. And feel free to check for / reach out
with any questions on the Discord server (found at the bottom of
the page).

## Scissor lift

A great way to develop with the Amiga, especially when working on
control applications, is to put it up on a scissor lift.
This way you can test measuring wheel odometry, controlling the
robot, and more without concern of running into anything or
pulling out any cables you may have connected.

We tend to use double scissor lifts, with a 770 lb capacity.
But what's most important is that the table is long enough to
lift the amiga from both crossbars.

- In the past, we've run to Home Depot and purchased: [**Eoslift 770 lb double scissor lift**](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Eoslift-Industrial-Grade-Heavy-Duty-TAD35-Manual-Double-Scissor-Lift-Table-Cart-770-lbs-Cap-20-5-in-x-39-7in-Swivel-Casters-TAD35/301884311
)
- And we've ordered from Uline: [**Uline 770 lb double scissor lift**](
