# Custom Applications Manifest

As explained in the [brain apps](/docs/brain/brain-apps) section, the brain apps and services are a way to extend the functionality of the brain.

In this section we will learn how to register the apps in the system into the launcher.

## Introduction

Each application can be defined in what we call a manifest file. This file contains the metadata of the app and is used by the launcher to display the app in the UI.
The manifest file is a JSON which in internally parsed by the launcher and automatically register each app and service as a [systemd service](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html).

The manifest file is located in the root directory of the `farm-ng-user-[<your_username>]` and is called `manifest.json` with the following
basic structure:

```json
{
   "services": {
        "example-service": {
            "name": "example-service",
            "type": "service",
            "exec_cmd": "/farm_ng_image/venv/bin/python3 example_service.py",
            "autostart": true
        },
   }
}
```

See next sections for a detailed description of each field and advanced usage to include multiple services and apps in the same manifest file.

## Manifest file format

The manifest file must be a valid JSON file that contains a `services` field with a list of services and apps to register in the system.

Each service or app is defined by a unique name and a set of fields that describe the service or app. For educational purposes, we will use the following example showing
all the supported fields and values:

```json
{
   "services": {
        "example-service": {
            "name": "example-service",
            "type": "service",
            "exec_cmd": "/farm_ng_image/venv/bin/python3 example_service.py",
            "args": [
                "--config",
                "/opt/farmng/config.json",
                "--port",
                "8042"
            ],
            "autostart": true,
            "http_gui_port": 8042,
            "display_name": "Example Service"
        },
   }
}
```

### Supported fields

The following fields are supported for services:

- `name`: The name of the service. This name must be unique and cannot be repeated in the same manifest file. It will be used as the name of the systemd service.
- `type`: The type of the service. This field must be set to `service` or `app`.
- `exec_cmd`: The command to execute to start the service. Usually the absolute path to the executable and could include your own virtual environment.
- `args`: Optional, list of arguments to pass to the executable.
- `autostart`: Whether the service should be started automatically when the brain boots. Default is `false`.
- `http_gui_port`: Optional, port where the service will serve the GUI in case of the webapps.
- `display_name`: Optional, name of the service to display in the launcher.


## Advanced usage

The manifest file can support multiple services and apps in the same file. This is useful to group related services and apps together with a list of dependencies.

One example is the `farm-ng-user-[<your_username>]` manifest file which contains all the services and apps that are installed by default in the brain.

```json
{
  "services": {
    "example-service": {
      "name": "example-service",
      "type": "service",
      "exec_cmd": "/farm_ng_image/venv/bin/python3 example_service.py",
      "autostart": true
    },
    "example-app": {
      "name": "example-app",
      "type": "app",
      "exec_cmd": "/farm_ng_image/venv/bin/python3 example_app.py",
      "deps": [
        "example-service"
      ],
      "http_gui_port": 8042,
      "display_name": "Example App"
    }
  }
}
```
