:::caution Warning
You will not be able to follow the examples and tutorials listed
below if you have not downloaded the farm-ng-amiga repository.
Please first follow the instructions at [Brain ADK Install](/docs/brain/brain-install.md).
:::

Now that you have downloaded the repository and have all the
correct packages installed, its time to put these new tools to
use. Below is where you can find some examples that utilize
different functionalities of the Amiga and a tutorial that guides
you through making your very own Amiga application. You can go
through the following in any order that you wish!

## 1. Concepts / Service Overviews

Either navigate to the `Concepts` tab located at the top of this page,
or go directly to the [Concepts Index](/docs/concepts/),
to read through details of the various services running on your Amiga's brain.

## 2. Examples

Either navigate to the `Examples` tab located at the top of this page,
or go directly to the [Examples Index](/docs/examples/examples-index),
to get started on running one of the available brain ADK examples
or Microcontroller examples.

## 3. Tutorials

Go through the
[Brain App Tutorials](/docs/examples/examples-index#brain-app-tutorials) that walk you through
creating custom applications that interact with cameras and drive
your Amiga from the brain!

## 4. Developing Custom applications

Follow the instructions at
[Developing Custom Applications](custom-applications.mdx)
to create your own great app for your Amiga!

## 5. API

Either navigate to the `API` tab located at the top of this page,
