## Features overview

:::note
**The farm-ng Brain is an Alpha level product subject to change.**
**Not all features are fully tested and validated.**
:::

The farm-ng Brain brings supercomputer performance to the edge,
in a ruggedized packaged designed for the harshest environments.
The Brain contains a NVIDIA Xavier NX which has up to 21 TOPS of
hardware accelerated computing power for machine learning and AI
applications, and paired it with a touch-screen display designed
to be outdoor-visible, creating both a user-interface and sensor
hub in a single, waterproof package.
This provides quick entry into the world of artificial
intelligence, and a single packaged solution for developing tools
and interfaces for outdoor autonomy.

Includes CAN bus, USB, and GIGe ethernet bus options.
