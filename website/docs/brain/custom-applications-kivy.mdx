# Developing Custom Applications

In this tutorial we will show you how to develop a custom [**Kivy**](https://kivy.org/) application for the Amiga Brain.

## Prerequisites

:::tip

Make sure that you have ssh access to the brain. If you don't have ssh access, please follow the [**SSH Access**](/docs/ssh) tutorial.

:::

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux/WSL" default>

```bash
apt install wget
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="MacOs" default>

```bash
brew install wget
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Follow the instructions below to select a [**Kivy**](https://kivy.org/) app
prepared by **farm-ng** or create an app from the
[**`amiga-app-template-kivy`**](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template-kivy) repository.

## Select an existing app

To test the app deployment process of a fully made app developed by farm-ng, e.g you can choose the [**camera-streamer-kivy**](https://github.com/farm-ng/camera-streamer-kivy)
example.

To clone the example click on one of the links in the previous sentence and click the green code button in GitHub and then copy the text highlighted in yellow.

### Run from the command line

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned the [**amiga-app-template-kivy**](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template-kivy) repository.

```bash
cd <to-your-app-directory>
DISPLAY=:0 ./entry.sh  # install and run
```

If all goes well, you'll see an dummy Kivy application on your brain screen.

### Run from the brain screen

In order to run the app from the brain screen, you need to copy the app to the brain.
To do so, you need to navigate to your app directory and run the `install.sh` script.

```bash
cd <to-your-app-directory>
./install.sh
```

You should now see your app on the brain screen. Click on it to launch it.

## Create a new app

To create your own custom application navigate to the [**`amiga-app-template-kivy`**](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template-kivy) repository on GitHub.
:::tip
You need to be signed into your GitHub account to see the option to `Use this template`.

Written instructions (same as video above):
1. Click on green *Use this template* button (top right) to create a new repository based on this repo
2. Fill out:
    - Owner: (your_username)
    - Repository Name: whatever-you-want
        - Should be between between 4-17 characters, and
        - Use underscores (_) or dashes (-) for separating words (no spaces!)
    -Select Public box
    -Click [Create repository from template]
Done!

Now that you are done creating your repository, you have two options:

1. Work in your local workspace.
2. Work in a remote Remote-SSH session using in vs-code.

In both cases you will have to clone the repository you created above by following the commands below.

```bash
cd <to-your-base-directory>
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```

### Project structure

In vs-code, you can see the project structure on the left side in the `EXPLORER`:

Below are listed the most important components.

```bash
repository-name/  # Root level of the project.
├── libs/ # Contains private libraries.
|   └── project_name/
|       ├── ops.py  # e.g a operators submodule
|       └── project_name_subpackage/
|           └── utils.py  # e.g a utilities submodule
├── src/ # Contains all code needed to run the main gui application.
|   ├── assets/  # Contains files needed to run the application
|   |   └── app_logo.png  # static images or images for buttons.
|   ├── res/  # Contains the layout files and UI strings.
|   |   └── main.kv  # main ui layout in Kivy languague
|   └── main.py  # Is the main entry point for the gui application.
├── test/  # Contains code for test of the private libs.
|   └── test_dummy.py  # sets of unit test.
├── install.sh
|    # The script to install the app on the brain.
├── uninstall.sh
|    # The script to uninstall the app from the brain.
├── manifest.json
|    # The file containing the metadata of the app to register it on the brain.
├── entry.sh
|    # The script to setup the project, create a virtual env. and install dependencies.
└── setup.cfg
    # The file containing the metadata of the package, including the name, versioning, etc. Learn more here: https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html

```

### How to setup the project

Before any changes, lets see if we can run this app locally on your system.

```bash
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY/
./entry.sh  # install and run
```

When running the above script, a virtual environment `venv` will be created and any dependencies will be installed.

If all goes well, you'll see an dummy kivy application on your screen.

## Customizing an app

In order to customize an app we leverage the `setup.cfg` that contains all the metadata and package configuration.
More can be found [here](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html)!

The most important first steps are to modify the metadata of the project and dependencies:

1. Inside the `setup.cfg` file, adjust the fields under the tag `[metadata]`
    * For basic users, the package name (`project_name` in the project structure above) goes in the `name` field, and must match with the directory name right under the `libs/` directory.
      * I.e., change both the `name` field and the directory name under `libs/` to your new app name.
      * VScode should prompt you to change the import names in `test_dummy.py` once you change the directory name.
        * If not, manually change:
            ```
            from amiga_package import __version__
            from amiga_package import ops
            ```
        * To:
            ```
            from <project_name> import __version__
            from <project_name> import ops
            ```
    * For advanced users, you can modify as much is compliant with Python `setuptools`.
2. Adjust the package dependencies
    * Include whatever extra dependency you need in the `install_requires` field.
    * Our only requirements are:
        * `wheel`: for packaging the app.
        * `kivy`: to generate the graphical user interface (GUI).
        * `farm-ng-amiga`: the Farm-ng Amiga public SDK.

### Update the `manifest.json`

In this file, you can find the metadata of the app. This file is used by the launcher
and has the following structure:

```json
{
   "services": {
        "example-app": {
            "type": "app_third_party",
            "python": false,
            "args": [
                "entry.sh"
            ],
            "display_name": "Example App"
        }
    }
}
```

:::warning

- `type` is `app_third_party`.
- `python` is `false`.
- `display_name` must be unique across all apps.

You can modify the `entry.sh` script but is a requirement that you start the app with a bash script.

## Development and Debug an app

The workflow for development is pretty much the same as any standard gui application.

1. Make changes in the code.
2. Run the code with the play button in vs-code.
    - [Optionally] Add a breakpoint to any line and use the Debug Console to interact.
3. Go to step 1)


## [Optional] Test your application

In order to validate your functionality, we suggest to add test cases for the internal `libs/[package_name]`
located under `test/test_[test_name].py`.

To launch the tests: `pytest test/`
To run specific tests: `pytest test/test_dummy.py::TestDummy::test_add`
