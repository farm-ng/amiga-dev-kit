# Developing Custom Applications

:::tip
We now have a full tutorial that walks you through creating custom applications that interact with cameras and drive your Amiga from the brain!

Check it out at [**Virtual Joystick Tutorial**](/examples/virtual_joystick/00_overview.md).
:::

## Quick Tips

* The Amiga user is able to install APT packages.
  * Edit the "entry.sh" script in the sample git repository.
* We leverage a venv per application.
  * The contents of requirements.txt will be installed by the bootstrap.sh script.
* If you've updated the requirements.txt remove the hidden ".lock" before relaunching the app from the Brain UI.
* You may use VSCode remote development/containers to edit directly on the Amiga brain as well.

## Prerequisites

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux/WSL" default>

```bash
apt install wget
python3 -m pip install --user cookiecutter
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="MacOs" default>

```bash
brew install wget
brew install cookiecutter
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initial Configuration

To make ssh between our workstation and the Amiga easier, we'll add some configuration to our ssh on the workstation.
To set up ssh, the Amiga and your computer should be on the same network.

First check if a file `~/.ssh/config` exists on your workstation.
`~/` is the home folder on your workstation.

:::info

1. If this file does not exist, you'll have to create it.

```bash
cd ~ # Navigate to your home folder
ls -a # Check for a folder called `.ssh/`
```

2. If `~/.ssh/` does not exist, run:

```bash
ssh-keygen # create ~/.ssh/ folder
```

3. Create a file called `config` (no extension) in `~/.ssh`

```bash
gedit ~/.ssh/config
```
:::

Add the following to your  `~/.ssh/config`:

```bash
Host amiga
    HostName <ip address>
    Port 22
    User amiga
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

:::tip tips

* `<ip address>` can be found on the bottom right of the Amiga Brain screen
* Remove the `<` & `>` symbols.
* Your development station and your Amiga should be on the same network.
:::
This utilizes the IP address displayed on the bottom right of the brain display:

Let’s copy our keys to the robot as well (you may need to do this any time you are working with a new robot)

```bash
ssh-copy-id amiga
```

Now you can ssh to the robot with:

```bash
ssh amiga
exit
```

:::caution troubleshooting
If, after a docker image update, you cannot `ssh` into your amiga or run the `sync.sh` script,
you may have an error similar to:

```bash
# $ ssh amiga
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the ECDSA key sent by the remote host is
SHA256:QsdOvROYuKMa5NqaPTFHwF3kfPCwKaTzgBAj9N/eKCI.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /home/<YOUR_NAME>/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending ECDSA key in /home/<YOUR_NAME>/.ssh/known_hosts:29
  remove with:
  ssh-keygen -f "/home/<YOUR_NAME>/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "192.168.XX.XX"
ECDSA host key for 192.168.XX.XX has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
```

Follow the instructions they provide and run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -f "/home/<YOUR_NAME>/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "192.168.XX.XX"
# With correct values for <YOUR_NAME> and IP Address XX.XX
```

You should now be able to `ssh` into your amiga and/or run the `sync.sh` script

## Prepare an app

Follow the instructions below to select an example from the [**`farm-ng-amiga` examples**](https://github.com/farm-ng/farm-ng-amiga/tree/main/py/examples) or create an app from the [`amiga-app-template`](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template) repository.

### Select an app

:::caution coming soon
The folder structure of the examples in [**farm-ng-amiga examples**](https://github.com/farm-ng/farm-ng-amiga/tree/main/py/examples) will soon be updated to match
the template repository for setup / install on the amiga.

In the meantime, follow the instructions to [**Create an app**](#create-an-app).
You can then copy the `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `assets/` directory (if present)
from the example and drop them into an app you create with the template repository.
:::

### Create an app

Use the [**`amiga-app-template`**](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template) repository to create your own custom application with the following instructions.

#### Create a repository from the template

Navigate to the [**`amiga-app-template`**](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template) repository on GitHub.

Click on green *Use this template* button (top right) to create a new repository based on this repo

![Create a new templated repository](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5157099/205272492-356c1540-948e-43dc-8f60-8992caa8d511.gif)

Fill in the details, example below:

* Owner: *username*
* Repository Name: hello-amiga (names should be between 4-17 characters)
* Set to Public

Once completed, click *[Create repository from template]*

When the repository creation process has completed, you have two options:

1. Work in your local workspace.
2. Work in a remote Remote-SSH session using in vs-code.

In both cases you will have to clone the created repository from above

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

## Project structure

In vs-code, you can see the project structure on the left side in the `EXPLORER`:

Below are listed the most important components.

```bash
repository-name/  # Root level of the project.
├── libs/ # Contains private libraries.
|   └── project_name/
|       ├── ops.py  # e.g a operators submodule
|       └── project_name_subpackage/
|           └── utils.py  # e.g a utilities submodule
├── src/ # Contains all code needed to run the main gui application.
|   ├── assets/  # Contains files needed to run the application
|   |   └── app_logo.png  # static images or images for buttons.
|   ├── res/  # Contains the layout files and UI strings.
|   |   └── main.kv  # main ui layout in Kivy languague
|   └── main.py  # Is the main entry point for the gui application.
├── test/  # Contains code for test of the private libs.
|   └── test_dummy.py  # sets of unit test.
├── entry.sh
|    # The script to setup the project, create a virtual env. and install dependencies.
└── setup.cfg
    # The file containing the metadata of the package, including the name, versioning, etc. Learn more here: https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html

```

## How to setup the project

Before any changes, lets see if we can run this app locally on your system.

```bash
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY/
./entry.sh  # install and run
```

When running the above script, a virtual environment `venv` will be created and any dependencies will be installed.

If all goes well, you'll see an dummy kivy application on your screen.

## Customizing an app

In order to customize an app we leverage the `setup.cfg` that contains all the metadata and package configuration. More: https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html

The most important first steps are to modify the metadata of the project and dependencies:

1. Inside the `setup.cfg` file, adjust the fields under the tag `[metadata]`
    * For basic users, the package name  goes in the `name` field, and must match with the directory name right under the `libs/` directory.
    * For advanced users, you can modify as much is complaint with Python `setuptools`.
2. Adjust the package dependencies
    * Include whatever extra dependency you need in the `install_requires` field.
    * Our only requirements are:
        * `wheel`: for packaging the app.
        * `kivy`: to generate the graphical user interface (GUI).
        * `farm-ng-amiga`: the Farm-ng Amiga public SDK.

In case you face issues, connect with us and the community:
* https://discourse.farm-ng.com/c/support/5



## Development and Debug an app

The workflow for development is pretty much the same as any standard gui application.

1. Make changes in the code.
2. Run the code with the play button in vs-code.
    - [Optionally] Add a breakpoint to any line and use the Debug Console to interact.
3. Go to step 1)


## [Optional] Test your application

In order to validate your functionality, we suggest to add test cases for the internal `libs/[package_name]`
located under `test/test_[test_name].py`.

To launch the tests: `pytest test/`
To run specific tests: `pytest test/test_dummy.py::TestDummy::test_add`

## SSH Configuration
Now it is time to configure your *config* file to *ssh* in your Amiga.

```bash
gedit ~/.ssh/config
```
Edit your *.ssh/config* file to include the below information.

```
Host amiga
    HostName <intranet ip address>
    Port 22
    User amiga
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

`<intranet ip address>` can be found on the bottom right of the Amiga Brain screen.

Copy your SSH key to the Amiga
* If you do not have a key created
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen
    ```
```bash
ssh-copy-id amiga
```

## Develop and test in the robot

In order to test your app in the robot, we require to push the changes to the remote repository created before and clone it to the robot.

We recommend to follow the next steps:

1. ssh to robot `ssh amiga`
2. Create an ssh key on the amiga `ssh-keygen`
3. Copy and add the key to your github user
4. Set username in git config

```bash
git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.name "YOUR-USERNAME"
```

5. clone you repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

6. Run the app on your Amiga

```bash
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY/
./entry.sh  # install and run
```
