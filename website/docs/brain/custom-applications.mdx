# Developing Custom Applications

:::tip
We now have a full tutorial that walks you through creating custom applications that interact with cameras and drive your Amiga from the brain!

Check it out at [Virtual Joystick Tutorial](/examples/virtual_joystick/00_overview.md).
:::

## Quick Tips

* The Amiga user is able to install APT packages.
  * Edit the "entry.sh" script in the sample git repository.
* We leverage a venv per application.
  * The contents of requirements.txt will be installed by the bootstrap.sh script.
* If you've updated the requirements.txt remove the hidden ".lock" before relaunching the app from the Brain UI.
* You may use VSCode remote development/containers to edit directly on the Amiga brain as well.

## Prerequisites

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux/WSL" default>

```bash
apt install wget
python3 -m pip install --user cookiecutter
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="MacOs" default>

```bash
brew install wget
brew install cookiecutter
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initial Configuration

To make ssh between our workstation and the Amiga easier, we'll add some configuration to our ssh on the workstation.

First check if a file `~/.ssh/config` exists on your workstation.
`~/` is the home folder on your workstation.

:::info

1. If this file does not exist, you'll have to create it.

```bash
cd ~ # Navigate to your home folder
ls -a # Check for a folder called `.ssh/`
```

2. If `~/.ssh/` does not exist, run:

```bash
ssh-keygen # create ~/.ssh/ folder
```

3. Create a file called `config` (no extension) in `~/.ssh`

:::

Add the following to your  `~/.ssh/config`:

```bash
Host amiga
    HostName <ip address>
    Port 22
    User amiga
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

:::tip tips

* `<ip address>` can be found on the bottom right of the Amiga Brain screen
* Remove the `<` & `>` symbols.
* Your development station and your Amiga should be on the same network.
:::
This utilizes the IP address displayed on the bottom right of the brain display:

Letâ€™s copy our keys to the robot as well (you may need to do this any time you are working with a new robot)

```bash
ssh-copy-id amiga
```

Now you can ssh to the robot with:

```bash
ssh amiga
exit
```

:::caution troubleshooting
If, after a docker image update, you cannot `ssh` into your amiga or run the `sync.sh` script,
you may have an error similar to:

```bash
# $ ssh amiga
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the ECDSA key sent by the remote host is
SHA256:QsdOvROYuKMa5NqaPTFHwF3kfPCwKaTzgBAj9N/eKCI.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /home/<YOUR_NAME>/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending ECDSA key in /home/<YOUR_NAME>/.ssh/known_hosts:29
  remove with:
  ssh-keygen -f "/home/<YOUR_NAME>/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "192.168.XX.XX"
ECDSA host key for 192.168.XX.XX has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
```

Follow the instructions they provide and run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -f "/home/<YOUR_NAME>/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "192.168.XX.XX"
# With correct values for <YOUR_NAME> and IP Address XX.XX
```

You should now be able to `ssh` into your amiga and/or run the `sync.sh` script

## Prepare an app

Follow the instructions below to select an example from the [`farm-ng-amiga` examples](https://github.com/farm-ng/farm-ng-amiga/tree/main/py/examples) or create an app from the [`amiga-app-template`](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template) repository.

### Select an app

:::caution coming soon
The folder structure of the examples in [farm-ng-amiga examples](https://github.com/farm-ng/farm-ng-amiga/tree/main/py/examples) will soon be updated to match
the template repository for setup / install on the amiga.

In the meantime, follow the instructions to [Create an app](#create-an-app).
You can then copy the `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `assets/` directory (if present)
from the example and drop them into an app you create with the template repository.
:::

### Create an app

Use the [`amiga-app-template`](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template) repository to create your own custom application with the following instructions.

#### Create a repository from the template

Navigate to the [`amiga-app-template`](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template) repository on GitHub.

Click on green *Use this template* button (top right) to create a new repository based on this repo

<!-- <img src="./assets/create_new_repo.gif" alt="Dash_Iso" width="600;" /> -->
![Create a new templated repository](./assets/create_new_repo.gif)

Fill in the details, example below:

* Owner: *username*
* Repository Name: hello-amiga (names should be between 4-17 characters)
* Set to Public

Once completed, click *[Create repository from template]*

When the repository creation process has completed, clone the repo to your local workspace

#### Create an app from the app template

You're now ready to create your first Kivy app, please choose a name between 4 and 17 characters run the *create app.sh* script

```bash
./create_app.sh
```

1. Enter your full name
2. press enter
3. enter your chosen app name as well.
4. Press enter again
5. Press enter once more to accept the formatted package name
    * Or rename the package as you desire

Your kivy application has been created under the *apps* directory

```bash
ls apps/
```

#### [Optional] Test the app locally

Before any changes, lets see if we can run this app locally on your system.

```bash
apps/<your app name>/entry.sh
```

When running the above script, a virtual environment will be created under the *`<application>`* directory and any dependencies will be installed.

If all goes well, you'll see an empty kivy application on your screen.

## Live Code Syncing

Now we'll start a synchronization session that will mirror the code in this directory to an Apps directory (/data/apps) on the Amiga Brain. Note: This directory is persistent across reboots.

Our current sync process leverages Mutagen, the sync.sh script will set this up for you. Please provide your sudo password if required. This will copy the Mutagen binary and agents to your local filesystem.
Additional documentation regarding Mutagen may be viewed at: [Mutagen](https://mutagen.io/documentation/introduction).

:::info
Run this from the app directory where you'll find `sync.sh`!
:::

To start the synchronization process in the background:

```bash
./sync.sh -s start
```

To stop the synchronization process:

```bash
./sync.sh -s stop
```

Finally to view the status:

```bash
./sync.sh -s status
```

While the sync process is running, any changes are mirrored to the Amiga Brain.

To test this process out, now that the current directory amiga-dev-kit/brain/examples/hello is being synchronized to your brain, lets trigger a refresh of the currently loaded apps by clicking on the "home" icon near the top right.

Click on the new app labeled "Hello" on the Amiga Brain. After a brief moment (bootstrapping the app) the app will load and you'll be greeting a a simple UI app. Close the app by clicking "Exit".

On your workstation, open the "main.py" file in an editor and change the value for YOUR_NAME to be your name (i.e. joe dirt). Save the file and relaunch the app from the Amiga Brain. The text will now reflect your changes.
