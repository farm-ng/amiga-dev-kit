# Developing Custom Applications

### Create an app

#### Create a repository from the template

To create your own custom application navigate to the [**`amiga-app-template`**](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-app-template) repository on GitHub.
:::tip
You need to be signed into your GitHub account to see the option to `Use this template`.

![Create a new templated repository](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5157099/205272492-356c1540-948e-43dc-8f60-8992caa8d511.gif)

Written instructions (same as video above):
1. Click on green *Use this template* button (top right) to create a new repository based on this repo
2. Fill out:
    - Owner: (your_username)
    - Repository Name: whatever-you-want
        - Should be between between 4-17 characters, and
        - Use underscores (_) or dashes (-) for separating words (no spaces!)
    -Select Public box
    -Click [Create repository from template]
Done!

Now that you have created a new git repository, you have two options:

1. Work in your local workspace (for development)
2. Work in a Remote-SSH session on your robot (deployment on a brain)

If you have not yet established a Remote-SSH connection, refer to this documentation:
https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/ssh/

For this example, we recommend option 2 and clone the repository directly onto the brain.

After you have established connection:

```bash
cd <to-your-base-directory>
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```


## Project structure

### Understand the structure of an app

Every modern app typically consists of two main parts: the backend and the frontend.
Let's dive into what each of these components does and how they interact with each other.

#### Backend:

The backend is like the brain of your app. It processes data, makes calculations,
communicates with databases, and performs all the logical operations. When you hear
terms like "server," "API," or "database," they're usually related to the backend.

In our example, we're using FastAPI to build our backend. FastAPI is a modern,
high-performance web framework for building APIs. Coupled with the farm-ng brain services,
 our backend will fetch and serve data efficiently and securely to the frontend.

**Key Points:**

1. Handles data processing, storage, and retrieval.
2. Communicates with other services and databases.
3. Secures data and ensures only authorized users can access it.

#### Frontend:

The frontend is the part of the app users see and interact with.
Think of it as the face of your app which includes everything that you can touch, click,
or interact with: buttons, images, text inputs, animations, and more.

For our frontend, we're using ReactJS. ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
It allows developers to create responsive and interactive UI components easily.

### Repository structure

In vs-code, you can see the project structure on the left side in the `EXPLORER`:

Below are listed the most important components:

```bash
repository-name/  # Root level of the project.
├── ts/ # Contains ReactJS frontend code.
|   ├── index.html  # The HTML template of the app frontend.
|   ├── package.json  # The file containing the dependencies of the project frontend.
|   └── src/
|       ├── components/  # Contains ReactJS components.
|       |   ├── TopicMonitor.tsx  # The component that displays the topic monitor.
|       |   └── App.tsx  # The main entry point of the app frontend.
|       └── main.tsx  # The main entry point of the app frontend.
├── main.py
|   # The main entry point of the app backend.
├── manifest.json
|   # The file containing the metadata of the project.
├── install.sh
|   # The script to register the app in the launcher.
├── uninstall.sh
|   # The script to unregister the app from the launcher.
└── requirements.txt
    # The file containing the dependencies of the project backend.
```

#### The `manifest.json` file

In this file, you can find the metadata of the app. This file is used by the launcher
and has the following structure:

In order to run the application, you will need to update YOUR_USER_HERE to reflect your user from fleet manager.

```json
{
  "services": {
    "example-app": {
      "name": "example-app",
      "type": "app",
      "exec_cmd": "/mnt/managed_home/farm-ng-user-YOUR_USER_HERE/amiga-app-template/venv/bin/python3
                   /mnt/managed_home/farm-ng-user-YOUR_USER_HERE/amiga-app-template/main.py",
      "args": [
        "--config /opt/farmng/config.json", "--port 8042"
      ],
      "autostart": true,
      "http_gui_port": 8042,
      "display_name": "Monitor App"
    }
  }
}
```
This might look something like:
```
/mnt/managed_home/farm-ng-user-jane/...
```

## How to setup the project
1. Begin by installing node version manager (nvm) in the /ts directory.

```bash
cd ts/
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

Once this has finished running, you should see the following message:
```bash
=> Close and reopen your terminal to start using nvm or run the following to use it now:

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```


2. Verify installation by closing and re-opening the terminal and running:
```bash
nvm --version
    0.34.0
```
You should see a version >= 0.34.0.


3. Prepare the frontend and compile the typescript code to javascript within the ts/ folder of your custom app

```bash
cd ts/
nvm install --lts
npm install
npm run build  # build the frontend
```

4. Prepare the backend

Install the dependencies of the backend

```bash
cd ..
python3 -m venv venv  # create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # activate the virtual environment
python -m pip install --upgrade pip # make sure pip is updated
pip install -r requirements.txt  # install dependencies
```

## How to run the project

### Run the backend in a terminal

```bash
python main.py --config /opt/farmng/config.json
```

Optionally, you can run into debug mode to use the local frontend instead of
the one served by the launcher.

```bash
python main.py --config /opt/farmng/config.json --debug
```
:::info
If when running main.py, a port error occurs:

```
[Errno 98] error while attempting to bind on address ('0.0.0.0', 8042): address already in use
```
This can occur while developing and can be resolved with:
```
sudo reboot
```
:::

To visualize the app in your browser, go to http://localhost:8042

### Run the app in the launcher

1. Register the app in the launcher

```bash
./install.sh
```

2. Now you should be able to see the app in the launcher and run it.

3. If for some reason you need to remove your app from the launcher

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

## Managing App Ownership and Access

When a custom application is registered, it is associated with a single user account.
This account is considered the "owner" of the application, and it's the only one that
can directly view service and app statuses or make changes to the application's code.

### Understanding the Single Owner Model
The single owner model ensures that only one user has control over the app's critical functions.
This model helps in maintaining the integrity and security of the application but can pose challenges
in collaborative environments.

### Switching Users
In scenarios where multiple users need to debug or modify the app, switching to the owner's user
account is necessary.
Here's how you can switch users:

1. Suppose `farm-ng-user-john` is the owner who registered the app.
2. Another user, `farm-ng-user-jane`, needs to make changes to the app.
3. Jane can switch to John's account by running the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    sudo -su farm-ng-user-john
    ```
4. This command switches Jane to John's user account, granting her the necessary control.

### Best Practices for Collaborative Environments
In collaborative settings, it's essential to have clear communication and understanding of who
the app owner is and the protocol for making changes.
Regularly updating documentation and maintaining a log of changes can help keep everyone on the same page.

## Debugging the App on the Launcher

:::warning
**Single Owner Limitation:** When a custom App is registered via the `manifest.json`,
it has a "single owner".
Only the app's owner can view service statuses and modify the code.
Other users must switch to the owner's account to gain these capabilities.
:::

#### Viewing Logs and Outputs

Once your project is launched through the farm-ng-launcher, it will no longer be runnable as a
standalone Python script.
Instead, you can monitor and debug it using the `journalctl` tool.
This tool allows you to view logs and outputs from your project in real-time.

To see a list of all running services, use:

```bash
journalctl -f --user-unit
```

Press Tab twice to auto-complete and view a list of all available services.
Look for your application, which will be named in the format `<your-app-name>.service`.

To view the outputs of your application, complete the `journalctl` command like this:

```bash
journalctl -f --user-unit <your-app-name>.service
```

#### Managing Your Application

If you make changes to the backend code, you'll need to restart your application for these changes to take effect.
This can be done using systemctl, which manages the application processes.

- To start your application:

```bash
systemctl --user start <your-app-name>.service
```

- To stop your application:

```bash
systemctl --user stop <your-app-name>.service
```

- To restart your application:

```bash
systemctl --user restart <your-app-name>.service
```
