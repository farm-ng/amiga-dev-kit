Things that will be included with Amiga

- Two batteries
- Battery charging kit
- Debug cable (only included with Brain)
- Service cable

## Batteries

Be sure to insert both battery packs in their respective locations on the Amiga.

:::tip
It is good practice to have both batteries plugged in and on at the same time
when powering the Amiga even though the Amiga can operate with only one battery
:::

## Starting the Amiga

First ensure the ESTOP is fully pressed down before operating anything on the Amiga

Once both batteries are installed with their respective keys,
plug the IEC power cables into both batteries, then turn the key to a horizon position to start Amiga.

You should see the farm-ng logo appear then the START/VAMOS screen.

### Calibrate the pendant

It is required to calibrate you pendant when you first start setup of your Amiga,
and anytime you replace the pendant.

:::caution

- Before testing pendant, you should press physical ESTOP so the Amiga does not drive while testing.

To do this you will need to go to the:

- `Settings tab` --> `Pendant` --> `Calibrate Pendant`

- If ESTOP screen appears, tap “CLEAR ESTOP”
- If other error message appears, try a power cycle by turning the Amiga on and off.
- If problem persists please submit an issue with us [**here**](https://discourse.farm-ng.com/c/support/5).
