## Feather M4 Can device setup

This device can be used for rapid prototyping of applications that interact with farm-ng's Amiga platform.

## Flashing the UF2 firmware on the M4 device

We run [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/) on the microcontrollers,
as it is well supported, well documented, and recommended by Adafruit for their microcontrollers.

CircuitPython is installed by flashing the microcontroller with the correct UF2 file, and you can tell if CircuitPython is installed if the microcontroller is mounted as a directory called `CIRCUITPY` whenever you connect it.

### On first connection

:::note
The following instructions summarize the
[**CircuitPython on Feather M4 CAN**](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m4-can-express/circuitpython-on-feather-m4-can)
instructions.
You can also check out the more generic
[**Adafruit Installing CircuitPython**](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-circuitpython) instructions.
:::

1. Connect your feather to your computer through the USB-C port on the feather
:::tip
Check that the large LED is green or randomly varying colored. If it is red, you are most likely using a charge only USB-C cable.
:::
2. Double click the reset button to enter `BOOTLOADER` mode, allowing you to flash the microcontroller with a Microsoft standard flash format uf2 file. The Feather should automatically remount and show up as `FTHRCANBOOT` or `FEATHERBOOT`
   :::tip
   The timing of the double click can be a little tricky, so if it mounts as `CIRCUITPY`, just try again until it mounts as `AMIGA`.
   If you cannot get the double click timing correct, you can enter BOOTLOADER mode with the following advanced user steps:

   - Open a serial console connected to the dashboard (see: [Adafruit connecting to the serial console](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/kattni-connecting-to-the-serial-console))
   - Pause the program with `ctrl+C`
   - Enter the following commands in the REPL

   ```
   import microcontroller
   microcontroller.on_next_reset(microcontroller.RunMode.BOOTLOADER)
   microcontroller.reset()
   ```
   :::

3. You can now flash the drive with the correct CircuitPython version, with either the drag & drop or the command line method.
4. After the flashing, feather should automatically update, reboot with the newly loaded firmware, and remount as `CIRCUITPY`

#### Flash by drag & drop

1. Download the correct UF2 file
   * From our repo: [Download CircuitPython 7.3.2 - Feather M4 CAN](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit/raw/main/circuitpy/feather_m4_can/uf2s/adafruit-circuitpython-feather_m4_can-en_US-7.3.2.uf2)
   * Directly from Adafruit: [Download CircuitPython 7.3.3 - Feather M4 CAN](https://downloads.circuitpython.org/bin/feather_m4_can/en_US/adafruit-circuitpython-feather_m4_can-en_US-7.3.3.uf2)

2. Copy (drag & drop) the UF2 file onto the feather mounted in `BOOTLOADER` mode.
3. It should automatically update and remount as `CIRCUITPY`

#### Flash UF2 by command line

These instructions show how to copy (flash) the UF2 file onto the Feather
from the cloned `amiga-dev-kit` repo, for each OS.


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>

From a terminal, use the command line:

```bash
cd ~/<to_your_base_directory>/amiga-dev-kit
cp circuitpy/feather_m4_can/uf2s/adafruit-circuitpython-feather_m4_can-en_US-7.3.2.uf2 \
/media/$USERNAME/FTHRCANBOOT/
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="MacOs">

In your system (or PyCharm) terminal, use the command line:

```bash
cd ~/<to_your_base_directory>/amiga-dev-kit
cp circuitpy/feather_m4_can/uf2s/adafruit-circuitpython-feather_m4_can-en_US-7.3.2.uf2 \
/Volumes/FTHRCANBOOT
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="wsl" label="WSL">

From a terminal, use the command line:

```bash
cd ~/<to_your_base_directory>/amiga-dev-kit
# mount the feather in wsl with 'd', assuming the feather is presenting as the D: drive on windows.
# Use the corresponding letter to the mounted drive.
sudo ./mnt_feather_wsl.sh d
cp circuitpy/feather_m4_can/uf2s/adafruit-circuitpython-feather_m4_can-en_US-7.3.2.uf2 /mnt/d/
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### On subsequent connection

When attaching a previously flashed Feather M4 device, it should automatically mount as `CIRCUITPY`.
You can always check the our [farm-ng adk uf2 dir](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit/tree/main/circuitpy/feather_m4_can/uf2s) or the [Feather M4 CAN UF2 page](https://circuitpython.org/board/feather_m4_can/) for future stable & experimental releases.

## Loading code on the Feather

Now that you have a flashed Feather, time to load some code:

1. Copy the `lib/` folder from [`amiga-dev-kit/circuitpy/`](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit/tree/main/circuitpy) to the root of the Feather. The contents of `lib/` are automatically added to your python path on the microcontroller.
2. Attach a serial terminal to the feather, so you can see std out.
   <Tabs>
   <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>

   ```bash
   screen /dev/ttyACM0
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOs">

   :::tip
   Use autocomplete to get the correct usb modem ``.../tty.usb[tab_for_autocomplete]``
   :::
   ```bash
   screen /dev/tty./dev/tty.usbmodem14201
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   :::tip
   Mu is the recommended serial console program by adafruit on their [CircuitPython serial console page](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/kattni-connecting-to-the-serial-console).
   Mu has a built in plotter for tuples printed to the serial console (print statements in the python code on your microcontroller).

   We've found that Mu can be a little unstable and freezes occasionally,
   so we'd recommend checking out their links for the "advanced" serial console:

   - [Windows serial console](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/advanced-serial-console-on-windows)
   - [Linux serial console](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/advanced-serial-console-on-linux)
   - [Mac serial console](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/advanced-serial-console-on-mac-and-linux)
   :::

3. Now add a `code.py` file to the root of the Feather drive. Try one of the examples found in the [Examples index](./../examples/examples_index.md), such as the [Hello MainLoop example](./../examples/hello_main_loop/).

:::note
The feather should automatically reload when you drop any new code onto it.

The feather automatically runs the file named `code.py`
and adds the contents of the `lib/` directory to the python path.
:::

You can also reload through the serial console by:
- Cancelling the current execution with `crtl+C`
- Reloading with `ctrl+D`
