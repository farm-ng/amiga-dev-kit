In this website you will find the full context of our
[**ADK repository**](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit),
including documentation, tutorials, & the development kit API.

:::tip documentation guide
To familiarize yourself and enhance your experience with the Amiga we recommend the following workflow:

- Read this introduction. It will give you a thorough understanding of what the Amiga is and what you can do with it.
- Get acquainted with the base platform and all its components by going to our [Quick Start Guide](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/amiga_quick_start/amiga-quick-start).
- Got an Intelligence Kit and want to know more about it?
Check our [Intelligence Kit Overview](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/intelligence-kit/overview-intel).
- Learn to access the Amiga Brain (SSH) remotely by visiting our [Access and Develop on the Brain](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/ssh/) page.
- Explore the services (e.g., GPS, Canbus, Recorder) running on your Amiga Brain in our [Development 101](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/concepts/system_overview/) page.
- Collect sensor data, organize it, and learn to manipulate it with our [Brain Examples](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/examples/examples-index)!
- Ready to build and deploy your own custom Apps to the Amiga? Check out the [Developing Custom Applications](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/brain/brain-apps)
page.

## The Amiga

The [**Amiga**](https://farm-ng.com/products/la-maquina-amiga) is
a comprehensive toolset of hardware and software developed by farm-ng to empower farmers, hackers, engineers, roboticists, and anyone with a vision to create ruggedized, waterproof, outdoor robotic rover
applications.

:::info
We love making tools and support a community of customizations and expansions which we will maintain forever. We will support you and hopefully inspire you to make the Amiga uniquely yours.

Please visit the [**farm-ng website**](<https://farm-ng.com/>),
