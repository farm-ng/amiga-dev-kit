### Welcome to the Amiga Development Kit!

In this website you will find full context on our
[ADK repository](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit), including documentation, tutorials, & the development kit API.

## The Amiga

The [Amiga](https://farm-ng.com/products/la-maquina-amiga) is a toolset of hardware and software built by farm-ng to enable farmers, hackers, engineers, roboticists, or anyone with a vision of creating ruggedized, waterproof, outdoor robotic rover applications.

:::info
We love making tools, and built the Amiga robot to empower and inspire farmers, engineers, hackers, communities, or anyone with a vision to make it their own.
The Amiga is a platform, community, and ecosystem of components built to customize the Amiga, extend it, and maintain it forever.

If you're just now learning about farm-ng and the Amiga robot, you should start by checking out the [**farm-ng website**](https://farm-ng.com/) to get an introduction to the [**Amiga**](https://farm-ng.com/products/la-maquina-amiga) robot.

Some of our Amiga development kit hacking projects have been hardened and listed as products on the [amiga-attachments page](https://farm-ng.com/collections/amiga-attachments). And we have additional products to help hackers get started available on our [`For Developers`](https://farm-ng.com/collections/for-developers) page.

## The Amiga Development Kit

The [Amiga Development Kit](https://farm-ng.com/products/microcontroller-kit)
is the best hardware option for hackers to get started with building custom applications for their Amiga robot.

We have a constantly expanding library of thorough examples, covering software and hardware,
to provide guidance and inspiration for your next project!
The code for these examples live in the [farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit Github repository](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit).
