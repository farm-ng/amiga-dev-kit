In this website you will find full context on our
[**ADK repository**](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit),
including documentation, tutorials, & the development kit API.

:::tip documentation guide
To familiarize yourself and enhance your interaction with the Amiga we recommend the following workflow:

- Start by reading this Introduction, it will give you a good understanding of what the Amiga is.
- To get acquainted to the base platform and all its components, make sure to check our
[Quick Start Guide](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/amiga_quick_start/amiga-quick-start).
- Got an Intelligence Kit and want to know more about it?
Check our [Intelligence Kit Overview](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/intelligence-kit/overview-intel).
- How do I access the Brain (SSH) and start developing on it?
Check out the [Access and Develop on the Brain](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/ssh/) webpage.
- Which services (e.g., GPS, camera, autonomy) are running on my Amiga and how do they interact
which each other?
Check our [Concepts](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/concepts/) tab!
- What kind of data can I get from the Amiga, and how to organize and manipulate it?
Check the [Brain Examples](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/examples/examples-index)!
- I am feeling confident and want to deploy my own Apps to the Amiga. How can I do that?
Check out the [Developing Custom Applications](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/brain/brain-apps)
webpage.

## The Amiga

The [**Amiga**](https://farm-ng.com/products/la-maquina-amiga) is
a toolset of hardware and software built by farm-ng to enable
farmers, hackers, engineers, roboticists, or anyone with a vision
of creating ruggedized, waterproof, outdoor robotic rover
applications.

:::info
We love making tools, and built the Amiga robot to empower and
inspire farmers, engineers, hackers, communities, or anyone with
a vision to make it their own.
The Amiga is a platform, community, and ecosystem of components
built to customize the Amiga, extend it, and maintain it forever.

If you're just now learning about farm-ng and the Amiga robot,
you should start by checking out the
[**farm-ng website**](<https://farm-ng.com/>),
to get an introduction to the
[**Amiga**](<https://farm-ng.com/products/la-maquina-amiga>) robot.

Some of our Amiga development kit hacking projects have been
hardened and listed as products on the
[**amiga-attachments page**](https://farm-ng.com/collections/amiga-attachments).
And we have additional products to help hackers get started
available on our [**`For Developers`**](https://farm-ng.com/collections/for-developers) page.

## The Amiga Development Kit

Buy the [**Amiga Development Kit**](https://farm-ng.com/products/microcontroller-kit),
which is the best hardware option for hackers to get started with
building custom applications for their Amiga robot. See the
[coding index](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/#microcontroller-kit-overview)
for how to load, run and develop code on the microcontroller.

We have a constantly expanding library of thorough examples,
covering software and hardware,
to provide guidance and inspiration for your next project!
The code for these examples live in the
[**farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit Github repository**](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit).
