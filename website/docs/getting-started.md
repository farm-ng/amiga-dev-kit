## The Amiga

The [**Amiga**](https://farm-ng.com/products/la-maquina-amiga) is
a toolset of hardware and software built by farm-ng to enable
farmers, hackers, engineers, roboticists, or anyone with a vision
of creating ruggedized, waterproof, outdoor robotic rover
applications.

:::info
We love making tools, and built the Amiga robot to empower and
inspire farmers, engineers, hackers, communities, or anyone with
a vision to make it their own.
The Amiga is a platform, community, and ecosystem of components
built to customize the Amiga, extend it, and maintain it forever.

If you're just now learning about farm-ng and the Amiga robot,
you should start by checking out the
[**farm-ng website**](<https://farm-ng.com/>),
to get an introduction to the
[**Amiga**](<https://farm-ng.com/products/la-maquina-amiga>) robot.

Some of our Amiga development kit hacking projects have been
hardened and listed as products on the
[**amiga-attachments page**](https://farm-ng.com/collections/amiga-attachments).
And we have additional products to help hackers get started
available on our [**`For Developers`**](https://farm-ng.com/collections/for-developers) page.

## The Amiga Development Kit

Buy the [**Amiga Development Kit**](https://farm-ng.com/products/microcontroller-kit),
which is the best hardware option for hackers to get started with
building custom applications for their Amiga robot. See the
[coding index](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/#microcontroller-kit-overview)
for how to load, run and develop code on the microcontroller.

We have a constantly expanding library of thorough examples,
covering software and hardware,
to provide guidance and inspiration for your next project!
The code for these examples live in the
[**farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit Github repository**](https://github.com/farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit).
