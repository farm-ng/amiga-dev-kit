There are two distinct, yet compatible, APIs.
<!-- One for running on microcontrollers, like the [farm-ng mcu kit](docs/../mcu_kit/README.mdx),
and one for running on the [farm-ng Brain](docs/../brain/README.md). -->


## Farm-ng microcontroller ADK

The API of the farm-ng microcontroller development kit.
This is [**CircuitPython**](https://circuitpython.org/) and is for running directly on microcontrollers,
like the [**farm-ng microcontroller kit**](docs/../mcu_kit/README.mdx).


## Farm-ng Brain ADK

The API of the farm-ng Brain development kit.
This is for running directly on the [**farm-ng Brain**](docs/../brain/README.md).
