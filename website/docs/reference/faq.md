## Using the REPL

<details>
  <summary>What is the REPL?</summary>
  <div>
    The REPL is the "Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop", an interactive
    terminal for running CircuitPython commands directly on the
    microcontroller.
    <br/><br/>
    Some basics:
    <br/>
    - You can interrupt the running code with <code>ctrl+C</code>
    <br/>
    - You can enter CircuitPython commands (or paste them with a
    right click) following the <code>>>></code> and run them with
    <code>Enter</code>
    <br/>
    - You can restart the previously running application with
    <code>ctrl+D</code>
    <br/>
    - You can find more details at: <a
      href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/the-repl">Adafruit "The REPL"</a>.

<details>
  <summary>How do I connect to the REPL?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
    There are multiple methods for connecting to the serial
    console of your microcontrollers (dashboard, pendant, MCU
    kit, etc.).
    <br/><br/>
    The Advanced serial console is recommended, but Mu is easier
    to get started with and has some useful added-on
    functionality (like a plotter for printed tuples).
    <br/><br/>
    The pendant, and other simple microcontrollers, will show up
    as a single serial port.
    The dashboard will show up as two ports, one for the console
    and one for data transfer.
    The first port should be the console you want to connect to
    for stopping the program, running commands in the REPL, etc.

      <summary>Mu</summary>
      <div>
        Mu is the recommended starter serial console program by
        adafruit on their  <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/kattni-connecting-to-the-serial-console">CircuitPython
        serial console page</a>.
        Mu has a built in plotter for tuples printed to the
        serial console (print statements in the python code on
        your microcontroller), which can be convenient for
        debugging.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        However, we've found that Mu can be a little unstable,
        freezes occasionally, and lacks some useful advanced
        functionality.
        So we'd recommend checking out their links for the
        advanced serial consoles for most purposes.

  <summary>Which port / console do I choose?</summary>
  <div>
    As described in the Adafruit advanced serial console links,
    you can query the devices on Linux & Mac with:<br/><code>ls /
    dev/ttyACM*</code> or find the Windows <code>COM</code> port
    in the Device Manager.
    <br/><br/>
    - The pendant, and other simple microcontrollers, will show
    up as a single serial port.
    <br/>
    - The dashboard will show up as two ports, one for the
    console and one for data transfer.
    The first port should be the console you want to connect to
    for stopping the program, running commands in the REPL, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Keep in mind that the ports will increment as you connect
    multiple devices.
