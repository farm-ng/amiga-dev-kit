This example shows how to use the `farm-ng-amiga` library to detect people in a video stream.

It also shows how to implement a service and client via grpc.

The requirements to run this example are to have a [**farm-ng brain**](/docs/brain/) running Oak cameras and that your PC is on the same local network as the brain.

For testing you can use your webcam as a replacement, which we will go over later in this tutorial.

### 1. Install the [farm-ng Brain ADK package](/docs/brain/brain-install)

### 2. Setup
:::tip

It is recommended to also install these dependencies and run the example in the brain ADK virtual environment.

:::

Create first a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

```bash
#assuming you have the farm-ng-amiga repository.
cd farm-ng-amiga/py/examples/people_detection
```
### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Download the model data
In this example we use MobileNet SSD from tensorflow to be implemented in opencv.

Download the model weights and architecture:

```bash
mkdir models
```
```bash
wget https://github.com/rdeepc/ExploreOpencvDnn/raw/master/models/frozen_inference_graph.pb -O models/frozen_inference_graph.pb
```
```bash
wget https://github.com/rdeepc/ExploreOpencvDnn/raw/master/models/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.pbtxt -O models/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.pbtxt
```
### 4. Run the service
Open one terminal or in that same terminal run the service:

```bash
python service.py --port 50090 --models-dir models/
# INFO:__main__:Loaded model: /home/edgar/software/farm-ng-amiga/py/examples/people_detection/models
# INFO:__main__:Starting server on port 50090
# INFO:__main__:Server started
```
![server](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64480560/229893034-7302d479-692a-4907-98e1-87a31b60fc19.png)

:::tip
With this command, you can run this on either your computer or your Amiga!
:::

### 5. Run the Client

In another terminal, run the a pipeline using the client:
```bash
python main.py --port-camera 50051 --port-detector 50090
```
And you should see a window with the video stream and the detected people. The server is a process receives the decoded images then computes an AI model and returns the results. If you have a service on your machine and the client consume from the robot, there is the transmission overhead of grpc from the robot-camera to you laptop (service).

:::tip
You can also run this command from either your computer or your Amiga.

:::tip
We highgly recommend to have some basic knowledge about [**`asyncio`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).
