Welcome to the Amiga Development Kit!

Please check out the [Amiga Development Kit documentation](https://farm-ng.github.io/amiga-dev-kit/)
for full context on this repository, where you'll find documentation, tutorials, & the API.

If you're just now learning about farm-ng and the Amiga robot,
check out our website:

## <https://farm-ng.com/>

The Amiga, and accompanying development kit,
is a [toolset](https://farm-ng.com/collections/amiga-attachments) of hardware
and software built by farm-ng to enable farmers, hackers,
engineers, roboticists, or anyone with a vision of creating
ruggedized, waterproof, outdoor robotic rover applications.

## Directory structure

### Brain

See [brain/](/brain/) for instructions on building the `farm_ng`
lib for the brain and example applications for interacting with
the [farm-ng brain](https://farm-ng.github.io/amiga-dev-kit/docs/brain/).

### Circuitpy

* Farm-ng's feather microcontroller kit's introduction/overview
and buying page is at the
[Amiga Development Kit](https://farm-ng.github.io/amiga-dev-kit)
website.
* Farm-ng's github CircuitPython codebase is here: [circuitpy/](/circuitpy/).
  * After attaching a USB cable to the feather chip, follow
  instructions to get circuitpy onto the microcontroller board
  [here](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/mcu_kit/#loading-code-on-the-feather).
* Hardware setup of farm-ng's feather microcontroller and running
farm-ng's codebase on the chip is [here](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/mcu_kit/)
  * Once you copy your own or farm-ng's code onto the
  microcontroller, you can use vscode to just open the the root
  directory to actively work on the files there. Any `code.py`
  file in the root directory will automatically run, but in the
  terminal ^D will cause the microcontroller to restart code
  execution.
  * To develop on a laptop, you can enter the REPL in a number of
  ways, discussed in [FAQ - Using the REPL](https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/reference/faq#using-the-repl)
    * On linux, you can use `screen` program such that python
    print statements show up. Running `code.py` with `screen` is
    described [here]
      (<https://amiga.farm-ng.com/docs/mcu_kit/#loading-code-on-the-feather>)

## Cloning the Amiga Development Kit

Clone this repository to work with the Amiga from
micro-controllers or your personal computer (Mac/Linux/Windows).

```bash
cd <to_your_base_directory>
git clone git@github.com:farm-ng/amiga-dev-kit.git
```

### Develop using PyCharm

In Pycharm, you can:

* Create a new project
* Use the menu: `VCS` -> `Checkout From Version Control` -> `Git`
* Enter the github SSH URL and set the directory
  * Now the project will manage the github connection and venv
  for you
